At best, last decade produced well-crafted family fare, Sonic Hedgehog Detective Pikachu; worst, genre found defined string cynical mediocrities unwatchable failures.
The challenge tends two-fold.
Video games – capable telling compelling stories terms – translate naturally movies TV shows; people charge financing making movies TV shows known little respect makes worth adapting first place.
Neither case HBO's remarkable nine-part adaptation The Last Us, generally regarded one greatest video game stories ever told.
More like this: – 11 TV shows watch January– How apocalypse reimagined– The controversial show 2022Originally released 2013, The Last Us set amidst ravages post-apocalyptic US, 20 years parasitic fungus called Cordyceps turned population mindless monsters.
It follows hardened smuggler named Joel, played show Pedro Pascal, tasked escorting across country Ellie (Bella Ramsey), teenage girl apparent rare immunity infection.
In interview The New Yorker, creator Neil Druckmann recalled how, 2014, film adaptation fell executives wanted make bigger ""sexier"", like Brad Pitt film World War Z.
The game, however, offers intimate story.
It character study astonishing depth, offering around 15 hours gameplay.
It burns dark, violent, slow; thick atmosphere melancholy dread; heavily influenced aesthetics prestige television cinema.
Druckmann referenced Coen Brothers film No Country Old Men touchstone.
It essence captured deftly small-screen iteration Druckmann co-showrunner Craig Mazin, writer behind similarly dark atmospheric 2019 HBO drama Chernobyl.
It faithful adaptation everything look score feel, early episodes particular following game almost beat-for-beat.
We meet loving father Joel day outbreak, desperately tries keep daughter Sarah (Nico Parker) safe chaotic, crumbling Texas.
The infected fast rabid first, cut 20 years later Cordyceps spread brain body, creating array monstrosities.
The terrifying Clickers, whose fungi-covered eyes mean possess super-sensitive hearing.

But Pascal also sensitive, soulful actor, seeing Joel soften thaw throughout series one great pleasures.The reason change Ellie, Joel must deliver group called Fireflies – revolutionary militia fighting bring FEDRA restore democracy – hope use immunity develop vaccine.
The show essentially lives dies casting Ellie, playful profane endearingly obnoxious.
Thankfully Bella Ramsey, best known brief turn Lyanna Mormont Game Thrones, steals every scene in.
Her Ellie loveable little terror, full charisma bravado, serving perfect foil Pascal's stoicism.
There's real wit warmth writing too, Ellie gradually breaks Joel’s defences favourite book bad puns.

The video game, split four seasons across year, episodic nature, locations featuring sub-plot sketched letters mementos player finds.
The show builds upon letters fleshes fully-formed stories.
And here, Druckmann Mazin audacious terms creative licence, The Last Us truly sings television.Episode three, example, turns series bitter letters two men called Bill Frank (implied lovers) tender romances.

future,"At first glance, saliva seems like pretty boring stuff, merely convenient way moisten food.
But reality quite different, scientists beginning understand.
The fluid interacts everything enters mouth, even though 99% water, profound influence flavours – enjoyment – eat drink.
""It liquid, liquid,"" says oral biologist Guy Carpenter King's College London.Scientists long understood saliva's functions: protects teeth, makes speech easier establishes welcoming environment foods enter mouth.
But researchers finding saliva also mediator translator, influencing food moves mouth sparks senses.
Emerging evidence suggests interactions saliva food may even help shape foods like eat.The substance salty, allows people taste saltiness potato chip.
It's acidic, spritz lemon stimulating.
The fluid's water salivary proteins lubricate mouthful food, enzymes amylase lipase kickstart process digestion.This wetting also dissolves chemical components taste, tastants, saliva travel interact taste buds.
Through saliva, says Jianshe Chen, food scientist Zhejiang Gongshang University Hangzhou, China, ""we detect chemical information food: flavour, taste.
""You might also like:Chen coined term ""food oral processing"" 2009 describe multidisciplinary field draws food science, physics food materials, body's physiological psychological responses food, more, subject wrote 2022 Annual Review Food Science Technology.
When people eat, explains, actually savour food itself, mixture food plus saliva.
For example, eater perceive sweet sour-tasting molecule bite food molecule reach taste buds – happen, must pass layer saliva coats tongue.That's given, says Carpenter, points flat soda tastes sweeter fizzy soda.
Researchers assumed bursting bubbles carbon dioxide fresh soda provided acidic hit essentially distracted brain sweetness.
But Carpenter colleagues studied process lab sort artificial mouth, found saliva prevented soda's bubbles flowing tongue palate.
Carpenter thinks backed-up bubbles could physically block sugars reaching taste receptors tongue.
With flat soda, bubbles build block sweet taste.Food scientist Jianshe Chen says saliva helps transfer chemical information food - like refreshing zing lemons - tastebuds (Credit: Flavia Morlachetti/Getty Images)Saliva also affect aromas – responsible vast majority perception flavour – arise food mouth.
As chew, flavour molecules food dissolve saliva, waft nasal cavity sensed myriad receptors there.
As result, people different salivary flow rates, different saliva composition – especially proteins called mucins – may different flavour experiences food beverage.For example, Spanish researchers measured flow saliva 10 volunteers evaluated wine fruity-flavoured esters added.
Volunteers produced saliva tended score flavours intense, possibly swallowed often thus forced aromas nasal passages, scientists found.
So wine enthusiasts proud ability detect nuances aroma may spit thank, least part.Saliva also plays star role perception texture.
Take astringency, dry feeling happens mouth drink red wine eat unripe fruit.
The wine actually make mouth drier.
Instead, molecules called tannins wine cause proteins precipitate saliva longer lubricates effectively.Saliva also helps us perceive difference high-fat low-fat foods.
Even two yoghurts look pour same, low-fat version feels drier mouth, says Anwesha Sarkar, food scientist UK's University Leeds.
""What trying understand property food, food interacting surface [of mouth],"" Sarkar says.
Milk fat combine saliva create layer droplets mask astringency add feeling richness yoghurt, says.Sarkar's research uses mechanical tongue, bathed artificial saliva, way simulate happens food moves mouth influences sensory experience eating.
A smoothie lower fat, Sarkar says, might look creamy first glance lack textural luxuriousness fat provides upon mixing saliva.Wine aficionados proud abilities detect flavour might saliva thank – least partly (Credit: Westend61/Getty Images)Fully understanding interactions saliva, food mouth – information transfers brain – could lead design healthier foods, says Sarkar.
She envisions developing ""gradient food"" might include enough sugar outside food dissolve saliva give sense sweetness would lower concentration calorie level whole food.
She says similar conceptual approach could help reduce fat foods.But understanding interactions well enough develop foods easy, saliva perception vary throughout day individuals.
Generally, saliva flows slowly morning fastest early afternoon.
And components individual's saliva – amounts certain proteins, example – vary throughout day, presence absence stimuli tantalising aromas.Oral biochemist Elsa Lamy University Évora Portugal investigated blindfolding volunteers, letting smell piece bread four minutes, monitoring saliva changes.
Two types protein, starch-digesting amylases others called cystatins linked taste sensitivity perception, increased exposure bread, found.
Lamy's group done similar experiments vanilla lemons, cases found changes levels saliva proteins, though specific changes depended food presented.
Her team working understand function may serve.The makeup saliva varies person person – depends partly individual's past food choices, says Ann-Marie Torregrossa, behavioural neuroscientist University Buffalo.
When Torregrossa fed rats diets containing bitter-tasting additives, observed noticeable increases multiple categories saliva proteins.
As changes happened, rats became likely accept bitterness food.
""The way think is, eat broccoli time, broccoli taste bad you,"" says Torregrossa.In another experiment, Torregrossa used catheters transfer saliva collected rats accustomed eating bitter diets mouths rats not.
The naive animals became tolerant bitter food, despite lack exposure.
But control animals supplied pumped-in, bitterness-tolerant saliva proteins still rejected bitter food.Torregrossa says team yet figure exactly proteins responsible tolerance.
They couple likely candidates, including proline-rich proteins protease inhibitors, could others.
They need know proteins involved assess responses bitter flavours tweaked mouth brain.The bubbles soda drinks may help mask sweetness drinks, become pronounced go flat (Credit: Catherine Falls Commercial/Getty Images)Of course, rats people – researchers found hints saliva similar things taste perception people, though picture complicated.
""There lot things human diets experiences influencing day-to-day experience, particularly foods flavours, rodents deal with,"" says Lissa Davis, sensory nutrition scientist Purdue University studies taste behaviour.But patterns decoded understood, potential great, says Lamy.
If could somehow provide kids additive encourages changes saliva therefore makes experience bitter vegetable palatable, could encourage healthier eating.
If first experience new food accompanied high level bitterness, says, ""probably associate good experience vegetable"".More broadly, building better understanding saliva influences taste – diet, turn, influences composition saliva – could open host new ways nudge dietary preferences toward healthy foods often reviled.
""How,"" says Torregrossa, ""can turn haters people love foods?
That's I'm obsessed with.

Sex education also part curriculum Dutch English primary schools I attended.
But many children across world properly taught sex get secondary school, all.
""There definitely still plenty children getting folk stories mythical answers babies come from,"" says Lucy Emmerson, chief executive Sex Education Forum UK.Could myths euphemisms – whether classic tales babies delivered storks found cabbage fields, modern, spontaneous inventions – actually affect attitudes sex long run?
And come first place?
A closer look oldest folk stories sex babies reveals fascinating insights people tell – might better.In Scotland, children placed cabbage leaves outside homes ask fairies bring new sibling (Credit: Emmanuel Lafont)The baby-stealing craneGrowing up, I frequently confronted stork tale.
Disney films, cartoons picture books told newborn babies found delivered parents elegant, long-legged birds.
The original myth, however, darker twist, bird stealing – rescuing, depending perspective – baby.The myth traced back ancient Greece, cranes, share many similarities storks, associated stealing babies.
In Greek mythology, Hera, goddess childbirth, turned rival Gerana crane elongated neck affair husband Zeus.
Unwilling part newborn child, Gerana picked baby, wrapped blanket, flew infant beak.Over time, crane conflated stork, says Paul Quinn, senior lecturer English literature University Chichester UK.
""There's link domesticity storks nest people's roofs.""
Another mythological layer added pelican, European medieval literature symbol Virgin Mary nurturing mother, says Quinn.
The pelican also associated breastfeeding, says, bird described picking chest feed chicks literature.By early 19th Century, stork started appearing fairytales.
Again, tended appear symbol domestic life family.
""Storks always associated family life visibly seen nursing young,"" says Marina Warner, professor English creative writing Birkbeck College, University London.
In fairytales, often come rescue human babies.
""The stork finds babies wells, ponds marshes beak pulls babies bundles sling,"" says Warner.This version popularised Hans Christian Andersen's story The Storks, published early 19th Century.
In Andersen's tale, white birds seek ""the pond little children lie, waiting till storks come take parents"".
""The prettiest little babies lie dreaming sweetly ever dream time come,"" Andersen writes.
""All parents glad little child, children pleased little brother sister.
""But cruel twist Andersen's story: badly behaved children given dead baby sibling stork punishment, make cry ""little dead brother"".Despite horrific ending, Andersen's tale quickly swept English-speaking world.
In Victorian Britain, stork became useful way embarrassed parents explain facts life children conceal realities sex childbirth, says Warner.In benign form, stork myth still lingers popular culture.
To day, common birthmark newborn's skin, caused blood vessel malformations, still called ""stork bite"", highlighting tale's influence.A similar confluence ancient beliefs parental squeamishness lies behind another colourful myth babies born: idea grown cabbage patches.The cabbage patch myth possibly originates various beliefs practices around plants fertility.
In Scotland, common children place cabbage leaves outside homes asking fairies bring new sibling, says Quinn.
Women also used eat cabbages boost fertility ensure successful pregnancy, says.Just like child rescued stork, cabbage patch baby ""found nature discovered part natural world"", says Warner.
In French term endearment young child ""mon petit chou"" (""my little cabbage""), notes.The story also lends sweet, child-friendly illustrations.
A series postcards published 1906 three sisters New Zealand show gardener tending field babies growing cabbage patches.
Well-dressed Edwardian couples shown wandering among fields, browsing babies growing there.
The gardener picks chosen cabbage baby presents couple.
Similar tales children grown gardens orchards exist around world, much-loved Japanese folk myth boy emerging peach.For Victorian parents, tales featuring stork cabbage patch babies offered ""way explain things children explain otherwise"", says Quinn.
""They know female body looked like inside … imagined inverted male body,"" says.
""So explain that?
The natural world obvious model go to.
""For Victorians, story Little Red Riding Hood contained important message risk talking strangers (Credit: Emmanuel Lafont)Warner agrees: ""A lot parents understood anatomy would really struggled explain facts life children.""
The tales provided handy answer.
But parents also used transmit coded messages sex relationships, says.Take Little Red Riding Hood, European fairy tale girl goes visit granny, way, stops talk seemingly friendly wolf.
During Victorian Age, parents would tell daughters fairytale warn interact men know, says Warner.
This women access contraception came romance pre-marital sex, ""the dangers great"", says.
There also ""real social shame"" associated unmarried pregnancy, adds.Harmful myths?While baby-delivering stork remains popular motif greeting cards gifts, may hard imagine 21st Century parents seriously trying persuade children babies born.
But myths euphemisms still surprisingly common, says Spring Chenoa Cooper, associate professor sexual health City University New York School Public Health.
One reason simply many parents still unsure talk facts.
""A lot people know actual scientific things saying know explain sex children.
""However, euphemisms feel comforting safe parents moment fact confusing children, says Emmerson Sex Education Forum UK.

""She engaging relationship understand sexual health anatomy,"" says Emmerson.Cooper agrees ""when people make assumptions based myths misinformation, harmful results"".In Australia, HPV vaccine, given young people prevent cervical cancer, commonly referred ""sex vaccine"".
This led girls wrongly believe protected sexually transmitted diseases meant partners need use condoms, says Cooper.Another danger using euphemisms set pattern discussing sex openly, experts say, making difficult children teens confide parents.
""They might experience assault, feel cannot speak it, get pregnant tell anybody get sexually transmitted disease treat it,"" says Cooper.

Gradually, figured reason excess illness seeing: air pollution caused nearby factories burning much coal.
In one 1909 incident affected Glasgow, 1,000 people died.There name pollution, Des Voeux coined one: ""smog"" – portmanteau smoke fog.
""He ask permission.

""But Bureau, everyone knowledge: feeling knowledge; experience, knowledge.
""So, Quante Escott see important work members public coin words, rather dreaming new vocabulary own.Capturing conflicting fears hopes becoming grandparent amid climate change, ""nonnapaura"" comes Italian (Credit: Javier Hirschfeld)To illustrate how, pair tell story word nonnapaura coined.
At event attended, woman called Linda Ruth Cutts came them, explained emotion climate change quite articulate.
""She said: 'I terrified children… I'm simultaneously wanting experience grandchildren.

""I grew speaking three languages, always frustrated English language anaemic compared French others there's lot emotions,"" says Quante.Another non-English neologism came conversation two young people El Salvadorian Korean origin Los Angeles.
There tensions respective communities, explains Escott, wanted word helped remind common.
They came chuco헐sol – mixture El Salvadorian slang, Korean Spanish.
It essentially means ""dirty – wow – Sun"", describes Los Angeles sunset.A mixture languages, ""chuco헐sol"" means ""dirty-wow-Sun"", applies polluted Los Angeles sunset (Credit: Javier Hirschfeld)""Los Angeles gorgeous sunsets perfect Instagram.

""They wanted say, 'We look Sun, experience pollution'.
They created word embody experience.
""We ask change mother tongues; ask adhere rules English language,"" continues.

In US, blamed rise cases Florida.
However, like much leprosy, degree armadillos responsible spreading disease humans characteristically unclear.
That's mention fact humans may given animals disease first place Europeans brought Brazil around 500 years ago.

Roughly 140,000 cases two years escaped detection per WHO data, oversight largely believed result strain Covid-19 pandemic placed healthcare systems around world.Historically, common many cultures quarantine people infected leprosy dedicated houses hospitals – sometimes even islands (Credit: Getty Images)""They diagnosed treated severe risk developing disability,"" says Smith.
Particularly concerning numbers children diagnosed pandemic-related disruptions.
At least 15,000 cases detected worldwide every year affect children.
To catch disease early would mean preventing life-long disability.
""However, numbers [of children receiving diagnosis] dropped 8,000-9,000 cases,"" says.
""That means lot children danger developing disease.
Some countries showing recovery, still low case detection countries like Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Philippines.
At time, we're really facing acute challenge,"" says.
The world made great strides leprosy treatment last four decades, especially WHO’s introduction multi-drug therapy treat multibacillary leprosy 1982.
Multibacillary leprosy advanced form disease, often characterised skin lesions disability.
One new treatment multidrug therapy, (MDT) – combination three pills, two taken month another daily.
It huge impact terms stopping progression disease, bringing us close cure may possible preventing disability among affected.
But able stop new cases emerging, explains Venkata Pemmaraju, acting team leader WHO global Leprosy Programme working leprosy related issues past four decades.
Old challengesSo makes ancient disease persistent?
According Sunkara, number factors involved.
For one, M. leprae replicates extremely slowly, take two 20 years infected person shows symptoms disease.
The average incubation time (the time exposure bacteria symptoms first appearing) disease five years, rare cases, patient may symptoms two decades.
It's yet possible grow bacteria causes leprosy petri dish, researchers use armadillos study (Credit: Getty Images)""This bacteria longer incubation time,"" says Sunkara.
""It takes 14 days one bacteria divide two body, compared disease causing bacteria double minutes,"" says Sunkara.
For comparison, optimal conditions common gut bacteria Escherichia coli, strains cause cases food poisoning, divide every 20 minutes.The long incubation time problematic patient, also around them.
During time, patient know they've infected pass infection others, particularly close contacts family members.Once leprosy infection become established developed multibacillary form, take two years treat, even combination antibiotics.
Another issue antibiotic resistance.
The original treatment leprosy antibiotic dapsone, discovered effective bacteria 1940s – then, incurable.
However, 1960s, drug becoming less effective.
Today several effective options, particularly antibiotic rifampicin.
The modern approach using several antibiotics together partly designed prevent resistance developing again, remains ongoing concern.
On hand, early diagnosis treatment, leprosy order magnitude easier eliminate.
Unfortunately, diagnosing leprosy extremely difficult.
At moment, standard method take biopsy.
With technique, tiny incision made skin lesion, blood squeezed tissue fluid pulp collected testing microscope.
But method laborious expensive, requiring laboratory technical expertise.
This particularly challenging rural areas, laboratory facilities always available, well low-income countries leprosy prevalent resources scarce.
""As result, many patients diagnosed late course disease nerve skin damage already occurred,"" says Sunkara.Leprosy much easier cure treated early (Credit: Alamy)The issue compounded fact scientists still know exactly leprosy spreads.
It's surprisingly difficult catch, often requires many months close contact infected person.
The current consensus likely transmitted via droplets air someone coughs sneezes, may routes skin.Recently scientists also found bacteria red squirrels living UK, despite extensive efforts, animal carriers yet found.
There even suggestions red squirrels could responsible spreading disease Medieval Europe.
Other possible natural reservoirs bacteria may exist even found survive soil according samples analysed UK, Bangladesh India.
However, armadillos, unclear wild pools leprosy might affecting transmission humans.
So, rather going laborious diagnostic process, one option blanket-treat people may exposed.
""In order prevent spread leprosy, 2018, WHO introduced significant intervention – close contacts leprosy patients tracked given single dose rifampicin,"" says Pemmaraju.
It found protective effect around 55-60%.
However, pandemic disrupted diagnosis, leading missing 140,000 cases worldwide, would impact leprosy's spread.
""Assuming leprosy patient 10 contacts, that's 1.5 million people risk developing leprosy able take single dose rifampicin,"" says Smith.Rifampicin treatment significant impact countries like Ghana, says Benedict Quao, leads National Leprosy Control Programme Ghana, member Global Partnership Zero Leprosy.
""For first time ever, countries medical guidelines could push political leadership act,"" says.
Though Covid-19 pandemic largely responsible disruption new programme, introduce one useful new tool: contact tracing.
The method helpful tracking contacts leprosy patients many areas receive dose preventative antibiotic.
The snag countries may able mobilise enough resources regular delivery rifampicin contacts leprosy patients, says Quao.
""In Ghana we've experience six 16 regions want ramp up.
It good time us intervention, perfect intervention.
Countries recognise that.
""It difficult diagnose leprosy quickly, partly bacteria grows slowly (Credit: Alamy)If effective rapid diagnostic test available – one non-invasive effective, many missing cases leprosy close contacts patients could diagosed, without need blanket prescriptions rifampicin potentially healthy individuals.
The good news diagnostic tests currently development – though may available time.
To study disease progression develop diagnostic tests, scientists often need inject M. leprae armadillos, technique first attempted 1971.
""The fact cannot culture [grow] bacteria easily laboratory settings another factor hindering progress developing tests,"" says Sunkara.
New horizonsSince 2000, Novartis Foundation partnered WHO, supplying drugs free cost globally multi-drug therapy.
In February 2022, partnered Fiocruz study uses artificial intelligence (AI) accelerate leprosy diagnosis.
""I call applying state-of-the-art technology ancient disease,"" says Sunkara.
There least 20-30 skin diseases present white patches skin, says Sunkara.
Using AI algorithm analyse way light reflects differently surface skin disease, possible identify leprosy cases, distinguishing similar conditions far accuracy.
Their study, published Lancet Regional Health, pegged accuracy 90% – 1,229 skin images, data set remains small moment.
If succeeds larger scale, might one day useful tool help speed diagnosis treatment.
Continuing stigmaWhile modern advances treatment diagnosis leprosy life-changing many patients, there's one problem never quite gone away: relentless discrimination.
""Leprosy remains deep-rooted human rights issue,"" says Alice Cruz, UN Special Rapporteur elimination discrimination persons affected leprosy, role held since November 2017.
There hundred laws discriminate people leprosy worldwide, creating strong stigma act barrier getting treatment, says.
In countries, leprosy grounds divorce.
In India, case laws amended 2019.
Many people affected disease still struggle get jobs, disease hinder access healthcare education.
""Countries everything power discriminatory laws abolished put place policy guarantee economic social rights people affected leprosy,"" says Cruz.
""Going forward, ask question: healthcare systems working afford full accessibility persons affected leprosy?
This leprosy much disease, became label dehumanises people affected it.

future,"Anzère often hailed Europe's greenest ski resort.
But Swiss village difficult start 2023 winter season.
Like many Alpine ski resorts, low-lying Anzère forced close pistes due lack snowfall rainy conditions late December first days January.The Alps experienced record high temperatures Christmas New Year, reaching 20.9C (70F) northwest Switzerland.
""It exceptionally warm Christmas New Year,"" says Stephanie Dijkman, director Anzère tourism.
""Nearly snow village gone.
I quite worried.""
People unable ski village, adds.Fortunately, started snowing early January, time arrival ""real skiing fans"" book trips outside holiday season hoping ""very good conditions"", says.But recent warm weather winter washout throughout Alps omen awaits ski industry.
Many resorts aware two options: close adapt business model cope mounting climate threats.From Swiss Alps Rocky Mountains, resorts grappling impacts climate change trying provide sufficient snow cover rapidly adapt changing conditions, envisaging future looks like warming world.Besides measures reduce emissions, investing renewable energy building Europe's largest wood-fired heating plant, Anzère planning ahead time skiing may longer viable.
""We're aware need adapt resort years come,"" says Dijkman.
""We're investing bike trails, climbing [routes] walking paths highlighting offer, whether summer winter.
""Climate change turning skiing endangered pastime.
Ski seasons becoming shorter slopes turning green temperatures rise.
Heavy rainfall Alpine resorts contributed snow melting slushy conditions.When temperatures rise, atmosphere ends holding water vapour leads rainfall, says Marie Cavitte, glaciologist climate researcher Catholic University Louvain Belgium.
""[When] temperatures increase, [water vapour] falls rain instead falling snow,"" adds.
""That happening low altitude ski stations, 1,600m (5,250ft).

""At low altitude resorts Europe, snow depth shrinking 3-4cm (1.2-1.6in) every 10 years, says Cavitte.Ski seasons becoming shorter slopes turning green temperatures rise (Credit: Dietmar Stiplovsek / Getty Images)Another major concern rapid disappearance glaciers.
Alpine resorts Tignes France rely glaciers snow cover water supply.
In European Alps, glaciers expected vanish almost completely 2100, UN Intergovernmental Panel Climate Change warning could lose 94% 2017 volume end century.
As temperatures rise, glacial ice melts faster less fresh snow.
Glaciers melting could lead severe flooding erosion valley increase risk avalanches, destroying critical infrastructure well significantly reducing water supplies local mountain communities.According 2017 study Institute Snow Avalanche Research, Alps could lose 70% snow cover 2100, global temperatures rise line business-as-usual.
The world currently track average 2.7C (4.9F) warming 2100.
If global temperature rise kept 2C (3.6F), though, reduction snow cover limited 30%, according study.Rising temperatures decreased snowfall shortening winter ski season, concerning trend mountain communities whose livelihood depends winter sports industry.In swathe US ski resorts covering combined area size Virginia, ski season shrank average 34 days 1982 2016, according 2018 study.Anzère's winter season shrunk days past 30 years, says Dijkman.
""But European resorts, [the season] shortened weeks obviously going quite big impact.
""A lack snow challenge ski resorts contending with.
""In United States, wildfires almost greater threat,"" says Auden Schendler, senior vice president sustainability Aspen Skiing Company, operates Aspen Snowmass resort Colorado.Over past five years, wildfires come dangerously close towns shut major highways ski region.
""We're already seeing fires ski resorts.
They're big threat loss snow,"" says Schendler, adding recent years resort also experienced mudslides caused extreme rainfall.The emissions travel took report story 0kg CO2.
The digital emissions story estimated 1.2g 3.6g CO2 per page view.
Find calculated figure here.Ski resorts scrambling ensure stay open entire season provide tourists snow-covered, picturesque settings expect.To this, harnessing huge snowmaking machines cover pistes fresh white powder.A study University Basel Switzerland warns resorts situated 1,800-2,000m (5,900-6,600ft), increasingly rely artificial snow keep higher ski slopes open 100 consecutive days, lower slopes may possible save.
This would raise water consumption 79% 2100.
During average winter towards end century, resort would consume 540 million litres (119 million gallons) water, compared today's 300 million litres (66 million gallons).
In French Alps, water consumption could increase ninefold 2100, according study.This could lead conflict skiing industry local communities may rely water hydropower, researchers warned.
(Read small hydropower plants long sustained remote communities Alps).The study also predicts huge rise operational costs ski resorts forced use artificial snowmaking maintain slopes.
This cannons distribute snow ploughs groom pistes incredibly energy-intensive run polluting fossil fuels.
There currently snow-making machines run renewables plans reduce overall emissions focused around improving efficiency.Solutions adapt changing climate mountains therefore ""ironically add CO2 atmosphere making climate problem worse"", says Cavitte.Even today, snow ploughs average account roughly 60% resort's carbon emissions, snow cannons contribute 25%, says Cavitte.

The resort introduced wide range sustainability measures, including newly installed 32 kilowatt (kW) solar array, improving efficiency buildings, reducing water usage protecting forests, says Amy Fonte, sustainability specialist head Forever Project.The resort also purchases renewable energy credits remaining electricity uses, including 38 chairlifts housing, says Fonte.Aspen Skiing Company, meanwhile, aiming source 100% renewable electricity power operations 2030.
""Ski resorts use fossil fuels lot energy.

Most resort already runs hydroelectricity, generated nearby Tseuzier dam.Anzère also car-free offers free public transport visitors, bid encourage people travel sustainably.
Tourists also role play helping reduce emissions preserving mountains, says Dijkman.
""It's mindset needs present among local businesses also among people come holiday.
""This starts choosing travel ski resort.

They number trillions include thousands different species.
Many microorganisms, including bacteria, archaea eukarya, long humans, evolved alongside us outnumber cells many times over.
Indeed, John Cryan, professor anatomy neuroscience University College Cork, rather strikingly put TEDx talk: ""When go bathroom shed microbes, think: becoming human.

And turns microbes call bodies home surprising amount control brains.
Over last decades, researchers started uncover curious, compelling – sometimes controversial – evidence suggest gut microbiota help keep brains prime working order helping free nutrients food, may also help shape thoughts behaviour.
Their findings may even potentially bolster understand lead new treatments range mental health conditions, depression anxiety schizophrenia.The picture still far complete, wake Covid-19 pandemic, deleterious impact people's mental health many parts world, unpicking puzzle could important ever.Our guts menagerie different species bacteria, appear communicate brains (Credit: Rodolfo Parulan Jr/Getty Images)One research field's key origin stories took place North American wilderness – and, warned, makes stomach-churning reading.
The year 1822 young trader named Alexis St Martin loitering outside trading post called Mackinac Island, Michigan, musket accidentally went next him, firing shot side less yard (91cm) away.
His injuries bad part lungs, part stomach good portion breakfast day spilled wound left side.
Death seemed certain, army surgeon named William Beaumont rode rescue saved St Martin's life, although took best part year multiple rounds surgery.What Beaumont repair, however, hole patient's stomach.
This persistent fistula would remain grim lasting legacy accident, Beaumont one pass good opportunity – however unpleasant.
Realising hole provided unique window human gut, spent years investigating intricacies St Martin's digestion.
Exactly willing volunteer St Martin open debate Beaumont employed servant conducting research – murky arrangement almost certainly considered ethical today.
Among findings Beaumont uncovered studies St Martin's guts, however, included affected owner's emotions, anger.Through finding, Beaumont, would go lauded ""father gastric physiology"", hit upon idea ""gut-brain axis"" – gut brain entirely independent one another instead interact, one influencing vice versa.
And know microorganisms within gut make process even complex remarkable.
""More research revealing gut microbiome influence brain behaviour across variety different animals,"" says Elaine Hsiao, associate professor integrative biology physiology, University California, Los Angeles (UCLA).
How exactly microbiota might influencing mind growing, pioneering still relatively novel field.
But advances last 20 years so, particularly animals.
And, slowly, case built suggest microorganisms vital part physical selves, also mental emotional selves, too.
""In medicine, tend compartmentalise body,"" says Cryan.
""So, talk issues brain, tend think neck upwards.
But need frame things evolutionarily.
It's important remember microbes humans existed, evolved 'friends benefits'.
There never time brain existed without signals coming microbes.

And mice, course, humans.
But given mindboggling complexities establishing causality microbial signals changes human thought behaviour, animal studies provided intriguing insights strange interactions bacteria brain.
Research, example, shows ""germ-free"" rats mice (those without microbiota reared sterile conditions) prone anxiousness, less sociable intact microbiota.
Germ-free mice, given antibiotics also found hyperactive, prone risky behaviour less able learn remember.
Antibiotics, reduce microbiota animal, also reduce shoaling behaviour zebrafish, probiotics boost it.Again, human brain vastly complex rodent fish, share similarities offer clues.
It makes sense bacteria, wherever live, might benefit helping hosts sociable less anxious.
By interacting people, example, help bacteria spread.
And whether they're really pulling strings, microbes' evolutionary interests make environment conducive survival possible.But communicative microbes, congregating zebrafish friendly mice really matter?
Hopefully, yes, say researchers.
Ultimately, better understanding processes could lead us towards ground-breaking new treatments range mental health conditions.
""We've coined term 'psychobiotics' [microbiota-based] interventions beneficial effect human brain,"" says Cryan.
""And psychobiotic approaches coming.
""There caveats, course.
While strains bacteria appear positive effect human mind, many others researchers yet definitively establish – how.
Humans also unfathomably complex, comes thinking mental health, countless factors play, genetics personality environment around us.
""We need many large-scale human studies take account individual differences,"" says Cryan.
""And maybe everyone respond single bacteria way everyone slightly different baseline microbiota anyway.
""Disclaimers aside, however, research could bring fresh hope.
""The good news change microbiota, there's whole lot change genetics – except blame parents grandparents,"" Cryan adds.
""The fact modify microbiota potentially gives agency health outcomes.""
Indeed, pro- prebiotic supplements, simple dietary changes, eating fermented foods fibre – even, perhaps, meditation – help alter microbiota ways benefit minds.Philip Burnet, associate professor University Oxford's department psychiatry, notes many mental health conditions associated changes microbiota.
Often, imbalance ""dysbiosis"" characterised reduced amount certain bacteria, particularly produce short-chain fatty acids (such butyrate, widely believed improve brain function) break fibre gut.Indeed, 2019 study Mireia Valles-Colomer, microbiologist KU Leuven University Leuven Belgium time, colleagues found correlation amount butyrate-producing bacteria wellbeing.
Specifically, researchers noted study that: ""Butyrate-producing Faecalibacterium Coprococcus bacteria consistently associated higher quality life indicators.

""Antibiotics change shoaling behaviour Zebrafish (Credit: Getty Images)Human studies communication gut, brain microbiota still relatively far between.
And Burnet urges caution: ""It known whether altered levels gut bacteria cause low mood whether microbial numbers change people depressed might modify eating habits eat less.
""Nevertheless, exploring prebiotics (which encourage bacteria grow) probiotics (live bacteria) might one day used psychobiotics nurture populations ""good"" bacteria – treat variety mental health conditions.For example, one 2019 study Burnet, Rita Baião, psychologist also University Oxford, colleagues uncovered particularly interesting findings.
Although study funded company manufactures probiotic bacteria, used randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial – considered gold standard study design neither participants researchers aware whether receiving treatment not.
The researchers investigated effect multispecies probiotic might emotional processing cognition people mild moderate depression.
But study also monitored mood experiment using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), measures depression severity.The participants, taking medication, either given placebo commercially available probiotic – contained 14 species bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium breve Bifidobacterium infantis four weeks.The results fascinating, least participants probiotic experienced significant subjective improvement mood compared group placebo, essentially becoming less depressed according PHQ-9.
Changes participants' levels anxiety, also measured, observed.This small (71 participants), brief study research needed prove causality.
But early indication ""psychobiotics"" may one day helpful treatment depression – particularly reluctant seek medical help take traditional antidepressants, says Burnet.
Indeed, psychobiotics replace existing medications – may eventually provide helpful adjunct.
""They make everyone happier,"" says Burnet, probiotics could one day complement established mental health treatments.
""Only time tell whether psychobiotics,"" adds.
""But field really moving forward...
This area research dominated animal studies, however, need human studies using larger numbers participants.
""But potential psychobiotics captured imaginations.
""We also attracted lot interest public,"" adds Burnet.
""People extremely interested maintaining health wellbeing natural supplements encouraging growth good bacteria support mental health captured imagination general public.
Especially now, people anxious depressed result pandemic.
""With Amy Chia-Ching Kao others, Burnet also explored role microorganisms might play psychosis – whether prebiotics (which help promote growth bacteria gut) might help people condition think clearly.
Many people aware psychosis cause hallucinations, delusions detachment reality.
But people psychosis also often encounter difficulties cognitive functions attention, memory problem-solving, impact ability hold jobs relationships.
While medication used treat hallucinations delusions, improving sufferers' cognitive impairments proved difficult.
A double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study Burnet Chia-Ching Kao, however, suggests possible way forward.
""We found giving prebiotic people psychosis improve cognitive function according clinical scales,"" says Burnet.At start study, participants medication free psychotic symptoms – still experiencing cognitive impairment typical psychosis.
Over 12 weeks, given prebiotic placebo metabolism, immunity level cognitive impairment measured time.
At end 12 weeks, switched, groups equal amount time prebiotic placebo.And effect small significant.
The prebiotic improved overall cognitive function, particularly attention problem solving, leading researchers conclude improvement sufficient boost social mental wellbeing.
There evidence participants' immunity metabolism changing clear prebiotic may triggered effect.
But another small step towards understanding relationship microbiota mental health potential development new treatments disorders affect thinking.There hints gut microbiota may affect cognitive skills broadly, too.
It well known antibiotics disrupt gut microbiota, affect cognition?
One recent study, monitored health wellbeing 14,542 female nurses several years worked NHS UK, found used antibiotics long periods time (more two months) scored lower cognitive tests learning, working memory attention tasks taken medication.
Importantly, cognition women taken antibiotics slightly poorer followed seven years later.
Although correlation, researchers think could due antibiotics-induced changes gut.Our gut microbes may even play role sociable research rodents believed – pick microbes contact others (Credit: Getty Images)There's still long way go, though, understand properly.
This fascinating highly complex field, research requires funding.
The rewards, however, could profound.
""There handful specific microbes studied far,"" says Hsiao.
""Not necessarily significant, scientists much really understand enormous diversity microbes gut function individually communities.
""I'm excited opportunity uncover new mechanistic understanding microbial symbionts work together promote health thwart disease.
""In meantime, perhaps pay bit attention microbiota.
A Mediterranean diet that's high fibre, particularly vegetables, likely good place start.
And fermented foods, kimchi kefir (a fermented milk drink) may also beneficial.
In small study 45 participants, example, Cryan colleagues showed put diet included lot fibre, prebiotics fermented food (such onions, yoghurt, kefir sauerkraut), reported feeling less stressed control group different diet.
""What I like fermented foods democratise science,"" says Cryan.
""They really cost much get fancy store.
You yourself.

""The relationship microbiota ""a bit like federation"", adds Cryan.
""These microbes fellow travellers.""

future,"Scroll parenting feeds social media, soon come across so-called milestone cards: pastel-coloured cards marking baby's first attempt crawling, sitting up, walking, along age.
It's social media developmental milestones become something celebrate – stress over.
One recent poll, example, found around six 10 US parents worried babies meeting developmental milestones.
But knew happen, when.Other parents may take opposite approach pay little attention timing new skills, trusting child develop pace.Which raises question: point milestones – parents use them?
Are crucial tool help us spot early something track?
Or another way parents ""one-up"" other?The answers depend, partly, exactly mean milestones.
For start, reasons healthcare professionals give importance differ parents' views.
""On concrete level, milestone description behaviour child parents either say child do, cannot do,"" says Chris Sheldrick, research associate professor Boston University focuses paediatric screening protocols.He points literal meaning word itself.
If 10K race, 5K point, might marker: milestone.
By definition, start race, no-one passed it.
By end race, everyone has.Checking individual baby's progress along markers help healthcare professionals assess development.
But since parents know child best, good idea know roughly babies tend things first time, experts say (though important caveats idea typical development, we'll get later).When parents take relaxed view milestones – assuming child yet tried crawling walking simply laid-back personality, example – may missing explanations, healthcare professionals say.Milestones tool spotting underlying problems, offering right support early (Credit: Getty Images)This article part Family Tree, series explores issues opportunities families around world face today – they'll shape tomorrow.
You might also like:""There absolutely kids whose personalities impact they're willing do.
So might ones trending towards later side,"" says Kaitlin Rickerd, paediatric physical therapist New York.
""But starts fall outside ranges expected, there's usually something needs addressed.
There's reason, matter big small might be.
""Developmental delays common, experienced one six children US.
A delay alone signify medical condition – one review 404 18-month-olds walking independently found two-thirds underlying pathology, example.When issue, though, intervening young possible key.
Delayed speech, example, signifier autism, late walking sign cerebral palsy.
Spotting differences early help parents understand support child's unique development.
""We know first three years life, amount brain growth, amount learning, amount milestones child acquiring huge – also means best window get make difference,"" says Rickerd.But milestones tool spotting underlying issues, says.
After working paediatrics older children, realised failure master one skill might caused cascade effect.
Take struggling hold pencil write: could relate weakness arches child's hands, could impacted weight-bearing baby, whether crawling tummy time, says.This professional view milestones primarily screening tool differs parents treat milestones everyday life: predictive, sometimes competitive, indicator ability talent.Indeed, evidence hitting certain milestones early indicative higher intelligence attaining education later.
But, says Sheldrick, true across whole populations, specific children.
If one-in-a-million chance professional soccer player typically developing child, early walker, might one 900,000, says.Which milestones marked celebrated may vary hugely cultures even individual families (Credit: Getty Images)And pushing children achieve milestones backfire.
There evidence frequent use baby walkers jumpers impede motor development, example.Even metaphor race mile marked stone quite fit complex reality human development, Sheldrick points out.
If watching race, know runners exactly 1K behind 5K milestone.
You estimate they'll hit it.
Once do, know exact moment happened.
And every runner finishes race reach point.Developmental milestones offer clarity.
Nor universal concept.
Their interpretation definition may vary considerably cultures – even individual families.
""A good example 'Can child walk?
',"" Sheldrick says.
""What mean 'walk'?
Can child walk mile?
Can walk way well back?
Have taken steps?""
This confusion new screening tools, like updated milestones recently put US Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC) American Academy Pediatrics (AAP), try use specific wording.Making complicated children develop quickly.
A child walking 18 months might running 19.
But child tested 18 months, might identified ""on track"".Then there's issue measurement.
How decide something ""should"" happen?
And data based on?The recent change CDC AAP's milestones list highlighted many issues.
For nearly 20 years, like many official milestone lists, based milestones 50th percentile – 50% children could something certain age, age milestone.This meant 50% caregivers might worry unnecessarily.
It also encouraged paediatricians take ""wait see"" approach children hit milestone, sometimes backfired.

Some children put mechanical ventilators help breathe.RSV typically hits youngest children hardest patients Agha colleagues treated lately tend approaching school age, around three four years old.
In age group, RSV would usually appear cold-like illness, runny nose cough.
But now, struggling.RSV, strep A, flu illnesses infections resurging among children, mostly suppressed Covid-19 lockdowns.
Here's doctors health authorities say parents keep children safe healthy winter.The NHS health authorities recommend washing hands soap 20 seconds help stop spread viruses bacteria, including strep A RSV.
They also recommend careful share potentially contaminated cups, towels items.Parents advised use tissues help children catch coughs sneezes, discard used tissues soon possible wash hands soap warm water stop spread.Making sure children's vaccinations date also protect wide range diseases – including flu many highly contagious potentially dangerous diseases measles polio.The step giving preventative antibiotics, example protect children midst strep A outbreak school nursery, needs carefully considered, doctors say, avoid encouraging antibiotic resistance.
Superbugs created antibiotics overuse posed particular threat newborns, highlighting need use antibiotics caution.
Plus, antibiotics effect viruses RSV.
""Everyone concerned, obviously, older children tolerate virus quite well – not?""
says.When Covid-19 rampaged across world, many countries introduced strict lockdowns thwart transmission virus.
Children kept schools nurseries weeks months end.
Now mixing again, doctors noticed periodic surges diseases, including RSV, flu illnesses caused Group A streptococcus, bacteria also known strep A.Sixteen children died UK since September following strep A infection.
According UK's Health Security Agency (UKHSA), 2017-18, last high season strep A country, total 27 deaths 18s recorded.
However, 2022-23 season yet over.Epidemiologists continue investigate whether Covid-19 lockdowns increased likelihood surges diseases, given respiratory infections less stopped tracks first year pandemic.
There also possibility catching Covid-19 increased children's susceptibility diseases harming immune systems somehow – though doctors say unlikely, evidence effect.
But exactly going on?For weeks now, routine conference calls fellow doctors around country, Ronny Cheung, consultant paediatrician London, heard reports strep A infections respiratory viruses causing problems children.
""It's notable,"" says.You may also interested in:Although strep A, example, usually life-threatening – might simply cause sore throat tonsillitis – rare cases, cause invasive, potentially deadly infections including meningitis.Cheung stresses recent deaths UK associated strep A extremely unusual: ""It make less tragic really important bear mind.

But difficult unpick natural seasonal variability.What data clearly shows that, 2020 2021, spread respiratory viruses plummeted, explains Connor Bamford, virologist Queen's University, Belfast.

""We seen data support prior Covid infection decreases immunity get severe subsequent infection virus even bacteria,"" says Agha.
She also says would not, general, expect see long-term impacts children's health immunity result happening now, though contract severe lung disease young might experience ongoing effects thereof.Either way, remains important protect children best possible, adds.
Bamford suggests applying social distancing, avoiding crowded places wearing masks situations.
Improving ventilation indoors could also help.For strep A, possible use preventative antibiotics order reduce likelihood infection within nursery school known risk.
But one would want targeted, avoid encouraging antibiotic resistance, says Clare Murray University Manchester.
""Giving whole school probably top,"" explains.
""Occasionally, we'll give whole class prophylaxis there's lot contact – new thing.

Hopefully things back less normal early next year, Agha suggests.Since Covid-19 lockdowns many children able go school, surges certain childhood illnesses (Credit: Getty Images)Does mean Covid-19 lockdowns bad idea, put children risk unnecessarily?
""I absolutely refute that,"" says Cheung, noting Covid-19 extremely dangerous caused large numbers deaths.

Apart tendency repetitively stroke soft fabrics run grains sand fingers, I also found swirling gentle rocking mesmerisingly soothing.When I eventually diagnosed autism much later life – age 60 – gave new understanding I behave way I do.
That includes certain childhood behaviours, fabric-stroking way I played toys insisted specific foods.
But also raised questions, might preferences reveal children autism experience world?
And could use understanding help children fulfil potential, form friendships, enjoy life?As science journalist, I naturally look scientific research answers – growing body evidence providing fascinating new insights behaviours long considered mystery.Autism Spectrum Disorder, autism, affects one every 100 children, according World Health Organization.
A developmental condition caused differences brain, affect person absorbs, processes responds information.
It usually categorised along spectrum, mild severe.
In Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders (DSM 5), published American Psychiatric Association, spectrum divided levels 1, 2 3, level 3 autism require ""very substantial support"".
Within categories, huge diversity needs experiences, well common traits.Take swirling rocking, example.
These kinds rhythmic repetitive actions – common feature autism – known self-stimulatory behaviour, ""stimming"".
They also include movements like hand flapping, foot shaking finger flicking.
Even today, I can't resist fondling cashmere faux fur clothes shops often furtively touch back someone's irresistibly soft coat public.
I also body rock occasionally, though ever private, I know makes observers uncomfortable.Stimming appear pointless even disturbing others.
As result, various treatments aimed changing reducing it.
But many behaviours associated autism, person engaging necessarily experiencing might think.Sue Nelson child family event (Credit: Sue Nelson)While forms stimming harmful addressed, child hitting head repeatedly wall, others useful helpful.
They out-of-control movements, instead serve purpose calming coping mechanism.
For many others, young old, rocking reduces anxiety.
""It's something that's repetitive soothing even latest Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders [DSM 5 American Psychiatric Association], 'psychiatric Bible', sorts behaviours classified purposeless,"" says Steven Kapp, developmental psychologist University Portsmouth diagnosed autism aged 13.
""So, I think lot researchers struggled understand people engage behaviours.
""Kapp's autism helps inform work and, recent years, increasing attempt researchers draw autistic people's views experience.
This different impressions judgments around them.For example, outside observers may interpret certain repetitive movements, including hand flapping, distress signal.
But 80% respondents 2015 survey people autism reported enjoyed stimming.Kapp led study autistic adults explore behaviour further.
Many said used stimming response sensory overload, including ""confusing, unpredictable, overwhelming environments"" caused anxiety – calmed movement.
But stimming also used simply release high emotion, including happiness excitement.However, study participants tended suppress soothing enjoyable movements public.
Several ""stimmed happily young children"" hid changed behaviour later, adolescence, became aware others judged negatively it, according study.
""There plenty autistic people still engage stimming,"" says Kapp.
""But we're less likely public [others] often understand, stigmatise it.
When people understand, they're likely accept it.
That's study I led found.""
The participants reported among accepting friends family, stimmed openly.Sue Nelson child father, grandmother one brothers (Credit: Sue Nelson)Tomato soup chocolate puddingSo-called repetitive restrictive behaviours (RRBs), include stimming well certain routines rituals, also affect family dynamics.
While tendency child constantly rearrange toys categories size colour rather play – common among autistic children – affect family much, I suspect only-eating-tomato-soup-and-chocolate-pudding phase bit issue.
Fortunately, parents accepted turn dinner table battle ground.In fact, many autistic children labelled ""fussy eaters"".
One large study found seven 10 atypical eating behaviours, common limited food preferences.
Research also shows children autism extremely sensitive flavours, smell textures.
It's sensory perception aspect and, me, relatable.
After initial restrictive food period childhood, I addicted variety highly spiced foods containing chilli garlic.
However, I still find difficult eat chopped egg sandwich without adding crisps textured crunch, thought white fish white sauce mashed potato makes queasy.Of course, many people food preferences aversions, autism.
But way sensory experiences, emotional aspects emotional regulation interact people autism, still fully understood.
This includes emotional impact sensory overload, powerful.Uta Frith, emeritus professor cognitive development University College London, spent career studying behaviour children autism.
In past, ""there theory emotions absent disturbed autism, I think true"", Frith says.
""On contrary, emotions much evidence, including high anxiety well anger aggression.""
This lead tantrum-like meltdowns, often caused sensory overload.Kapp says someone overstimulated light sound, ""maybe removing oneself environment getting accommodation like wearing headphones sunglasses, something dull sensation"" could help.
""Because lot autistic people hypersensitive perceive painfully sharply others,"" says.Friendship connectionResearch – especially, listening voices people autism – also helped overturn number misconceptions, common assumption people autism interested social interactions.
As one study notes, assumption autistic people solitary nature ""flatly contradicted testimony many autistic people themselves"" – included.
The desire solitude usually, me, socialising.
It's mental recharging batteries balance stimulation overload.Certain behaviours, low levels eye contact, may seen indicating lack social interest, may actually sensory coping strategy, study suggests.
Even researchers fall trap overly relying eye contact measure babies' children's social engagement, argue.When children autism asked experiences, tend report difficulties understanding forming relationships children, also tend say try initiate friendships feel lonely lack interaction.
""This suggests children traits may benefit careful monitoring interventions focused improving peer relationships,"" according authors one study.
In short, children autism enjoy benefit friendships, may need help forming them.This easier way meet children terms, research suggests – example, supporting another typical trait: special interests.Sue Nelson enjoyed specific sensory experiences child, stroking soft fabrics running grains sand fingers (Credit: Sue Nelson)Wildflowers, buttons, badges spaceScientists beginning understand people autism commonly form intense interests, benefits bring.
One study found develop average nine special interests, starting around age five.
These interests include certain objects, music, computers, nature gardening.As child, mine mathematics, wildflowers, science, buttons, badges, space superheroes.
Not much changed and, others like me, pursuing interests generally positive effect wellbeing social contact.
When children young people autism engage passions found wide range benefits, boosting emotional communication skills.There always activities autistic children tend instinctively dislike, even something routine haircuts.
I never enjoyed hair washed child visiting hairdresser remains uncomfortable experience.
While I always ensure surprise head massage shampoo, I anxious case forget.
For some, fear distaste induced sound scissors feel cut wet hair skin.
It's important understand simple sensations, many people enjoy, cause others distress.What often harder parents child want engage affectionate physical contact hugging, due differences sensory processing social communication.
Parents trying play kind simple give-and-take game may find children autism interested, parents may find hard.
""It's turn taking, reciprocation, sort copying [that children autism may struggle with],"" says Frith.
""The easy understanding another person does.
""Individual enjoyment social physical contact vary hugely.

The wider social environment also play crucial part.Jess* lives Hartlepool north England.

""He still got excluded occasionally seeing behavioural issues.
""Jess' son initially struggled lockdowns.
Eventually, Jess stopped trying persuade homework: ""He often went long bike rides was, therefore, much happier.

""Each day I lots coaxing reassurance tell things ok.

They mostly harmless, train immune system moderate activity, rather overreacting potential invader.Importantly, bodies meet old friends whenever spend time nature.
With increased urbanisation, reduced outdoor play, many children lack exposure – meaning immune systems sensitive threat, likely go overdrive.Various studies support idea.

Their early correspondence friendly, though according David Rains Wallace, author The Bonehunters' Revenge, perhaps little one-sided.
Cope wrote volubly, declaring friendship covering every square inch paper terrible handwriting.
His new friend Marsh quite forthcoming – Cope ""warm impetuous"", general opinion Marsh ""glacial unloved"".
""Marsh taciturn,"" says Wallace.
""He self-directed.""
He rarely shared needed to, even close acquaintances, preferring publish thoughts discoveries scientific journals first.
That way, little risk others stealing ideas.Their differences character appear put either off, begin with.
In early 1868, went expedition together Haddonfield, New Jersey, marl beds – mixture clay, silt sediments – held many Cretaceous fossils.
Ten years before, Cope's mentor Joseph Leidy identified one first dinosaur bones US Haddonfield, mentor student gone explore fossil beds together.
With characteristic candour, enthusiastic young Cope shared friend Marsh area's promising sites fossil hunting.
Cope knew area well, together discovered three new dinosaurs season.The rich offerings Haddonfield's fossil beds made deeper impression Marsh Cope anticipated.
When Cope later returned old haunts alone, longer able excavate fossils – Marsh paid site managers pledge bones found area alone.
It was, perhaps, Marsh's first overt transgression friendship.The names species dedicated years followed reveal growing tensions.
Cope made first move, declaring rather modest amphibian new science called Ptyonius marshii 1869.
Marsh responded ""gigantic serpent"" named Mosasaurus copeanus – however, specimen one quarries Cope showed Marsh, notes Sarah Shelley, postdoctoral researcher palaeontology University Edinburgh, studied Cope's early mammals.
""In year, Cope described another specimen named Mosasaurus depressus,"" says.Things got worse there.We may never get bottom exactly started – Marsh (left) Cope (right) (Credit: Alamy)Marsh may devious Cope flaws, contributed greatest mistake career.It happened remains large fossil skeleton dug western Kansas sent Cope identification.
Cope described fossil species new science, named Elasmosaurus platyurus.
It marine-dwelling reptile lived Cretaceous, related plesiosaurs, measuring around 40ft (12m) tip tail.
""It possesses tail great length, elevated, compressed adapted sculling ponderous body water.
The limbs appear disproportionately small,"" Cope wrote Academy Natural Sciences Philadelphia.
The animal's head neck, however, posed problems.
He noted loose rock sediment around fossil appeared conceal crucial details structure.One much larger detail, however, escaped attention.
When reconstructed skeleton, old associates Marsh Leidy came see it; reservations Cope, 28-year-old proving prodigious discovery remarkable new species.The reptile's head, colleagues saw almost immediately, alas wrong end, perched tip animal's tail.
As Cope first reconstructed it, E. platyurus extraordinarily long tail short neck.
It way round.
""He misidentified neck vertebrae tail vertebrae, vice versa,"" says David Bainbridge, palaeontologist veterinary anatomist University Cambridge.
""This partly skull found near know tail vertebrae.
Bones often get jumbled death fossilisation.
However, possible work 'which way round' vertebrae are.
""The first point error print Leidy, also used opportunity correct comparable error time.
Cope claimed Leidy bother tell paper mistake came print, Wallace notes.
Later on, Marsh would claim one first point error Cope – saying Cope took badly became enraged.
Whether lost temper, Cope clearly felt embarrassed mistake.
In later sketches E. platyurus, head migrated end.Cope notoriously hasty academic work, publishing 75 papers year peak – many short slapdash.
But putting E. platyurus' head end tail another level usual minor inexactitudes.
As historian Jane Davidson University Nevada, Reno writes, ""the question was, remains, could Cope made seemingly obvious mistake reconstructing E.

""Davidson argues Leidy, Cope's mentor, would likely wait years point mentee's mistake, print first rather person.
Leidy gentle agreeable person (who sported beard bushy Marsh's hair thick Cope's) disapproved Cope's war-like approach palaeontology.
More likely, Davidson suggests, Leidy spoke Cope error early on, Cope proud correct mistake.

He settled debunk discovery, soon name papers across country.Marsh perhaps first palaeontologist knew feed manipulate public's fascination ancient finds.
""A lot media excitement palaeontology began then, especially Marsh,"" says Wallace.
""Cope never able manipulate press well.
""Nor Cope's hasty publishing style allow establish reputation internationally degree Marsh, published less frequently care, reserving articles prestigious journals.

When Cope ""began speak wonderful animals earth, long ago today, absorbed become subject talked himself, looking straight ahead rarely turning toward me, I listened entranced"", assistant wrote.As Wallace argues book, ""If one American naturalist inspiration prehistoric images captured 20th Century's imagination, Cope.

Cope lost friendly candour talking fellow palaeontologists fossil sites, Marsh developed elaborate system codenames allies refer Cope (Jones), money (ammunition), success fossil collecting (health) even Pterodactyl (drag).No sooner Marsh would get ""notice new gigantic dinosaur"" press July 1877, describing animal found near Golden City stretching 50-60ft (15-18m)-long larger land animal known time, Cope would find bigger one.
In August, announced creature ""exceeds proportions land animal hitherto discovered, including one found near Golden City"".
He called Camarasaurus supremus.

""They're rushing quite lot work without really taking time study it.

""But excavating quickly, context fossils came from, position in, anything useful like that,"" says Bainbridge.
""One things learned feud speed excavate fossils necessarily important thing.
""Modern palaeontologists ""not quite obsessed new fossils used be"", Bainbridge says.
""Although, course, new fossils tend make news.
""Marsh went fossil-hunting west large contingents students field hands, often military escort (Credit: Peabody Museum)Safe say, Marsh Cope much obsessed naming new species.
They gathered vast quantities fossils, many extraordinary specimens remained sealed boxes deaths; owning fossils (and ensuring rival them) become important analysing them.
Worse, Cope accused Marsh ordering bone hunters smash fossils take back them, prevent Marsh's rivals – one particular – benefitting missed.
Marsh, course, denied this.It physical specimens fought over.

future,"It's problem humans reckoning since first moment food could eat one go.
When food abundant, store make last?Consumers partly responsible food waste.About 17% produce available consumers thrown away, though includes food supermarkets dispose shelves food goes restaurant bins, well household waste.The remaining losses happening farms, processing, distribution storage.The question almost many answers foods.
The ancient Greeks washed figs seawater dried hot sun, medieval China lemons oranges covered waxes.
In 15th Century Japan, vegetables coated soy milk prevent moisture loss extend shelf-life.
In 16th Century England, meanwhile, coated lard.The problem rotting apples mouldering grain may matter season-to-season survival ancestors.
Today preventing food waste less challenge, though stakes changed somewhat.
The world's greenhouse gas emissions wasted food 10 times greater UK.Wasted meat contributes numbers, energy required produce typically many times greater plant-based foods.
Throw 100g steak might squandered much equivalent 10kg CO2.
By mass, however, fruits vegetables make biggest pile wasted food: roughly half billion tonnes per year.
In UK, oranges mandarins number one among wasted produce, followed apples tomatoes.So best preserve fruit veg ensure gets plates?Among tools producers currently reduce food waste, many involve use plastics chemicals.
A Swiss study published 2022 showed climate benefits wrapping cucumbers plastic almost five times higher negative climate impacts packaging itself.
Chemicals chlorine, hydrogen peroxide trisodium phosphate, meanwhile, long used kill various microorganisms fresh produce prevent spoilage extend shelf lives.On tree, apples natural wax helps protect skin (Credit: Alamy)Yet customers turning away chemical treatments plastics.
Chlorination may lead formation compounds suspected carcinogens, may either end drinking water (as result industrial processing fruits vegetables) remain produce.When comes plastics, many us feel guilty amounts use.
According David McClements, food scientist University Massachusetts, ""big push replace plastics"" find ways preserve fruits vegetables involve chemical treatments.
While many new technologies still limited research labs, others starting appear supermarket shelves, soon will.Build barrierOne potentially promising technology edible coating: covering fruits vegetables film protective material consumed food.
Modern commercial coatings come fair way since early soy lard experiments Japan, England elsewhere.
Coatings based beeswax paraffin took 1930s, waxing fruits apples became popular.
Apples natural wax coating picked tree, though often lost washing process.
Today, artificial coating often reapplied apples, oranges, lemons fruits help conserve moisture extend shelf life.While pretty good limiting dehydration produce, still great room improvement.
To create perfect edible coatings scientists experimenting many different substances, silk fibroin (protein secreted silk worm) chitosan (a sugar outer skeleton shellfish), cashew gum, fish gelatine, fenugreek protein, soy protein, cellulose algae derivatives – list goes on.Such coatings, applied dipping, brushing spraying, form thin membrane surface of, say, strawberries tomatoes, reducing transfer gas water vapour, limiting browning aroma loss, ultimately prolonging shelf life.
Ideally coatings keep fruit vegetable well sealed, sealed – otherwise risk inducing anaerobic fermentation (that's apple turns cider, example).According McClements, chitosan, obtained by-product shrimp fisheries, figures quite prominently current efforts find perfect edible coating.
In one recent study covering strawberries chitosan whey protein isolate (a by-product cheesemaking), extended shelf life 60% stored fridge-like temperatures.
Tomatoes coating chitosan green algae, meanwhile, stayed close perfect even 30 days harvest (untreated tomatoes unappealing shape period).A number companies around world busy commercialising research edible coatings.
A California-based startup called Apeel Sciences, makes edible coatings plant oils double shelf life.
In US, find coatings apples, avocados limes; UK, they've partnered Tesco sell coated oranges lemons – things still typically peel eating, UK EU strict regulations comes edible coatings.
(The treatments applied citrus fruit peel one reason many recipes call unwaxed fruits.
)Plastic packaging causes problems pollution much can't recycled – also helps keep produce going off, reducing food waste (Credit: Alamy)Another company, Liquidseal, sells coatings based polyvinyl alcohols mangoes avocados UK – again, fruits hard peels only.
However, Liquidseal already developed edible coating cucumbers replace notorious plastic wraps, hopes sell Europe soon.Nano-treatmentAnother emerging way boost edible coatings use nano-materials – materials particle size less 100 nanometres (nm) least one dimension (that’s 1,000 times smaller human hair).
""If make particles smaller, improve functional performance edible films coatings, example, increasing strength barrier properties,"" McClements says.You produce minuscule particles using lasers, vibrations, plant extracts even certain microorganisms.
In one study, week storage room temperature, regular strawberries covered fungus.
Among coated chitosan nano-silver, however, 10% spoiled.
Freshly cut carrots coated silver nanoparticles stayed fine 70 days.
Uncoated carrots lasted mere four.Nanoparticles edible coatings, however.
Since powerful antimicrobials, added regular plastic packaging extend shelf life fruits, vegetables leafy greens.
What's more, used sensors could inform retailers customers food longer safe eat, could help avoid premature trips bin.
Researchers Canada’s McMaster University, example, developed patches could applied produce packaging predict spoilage.However, nanoscale interventions come safety questions.
In mice rats, ingestion zinc oxide nanoparticles causes liver kidney damage.
Studies silver nanoparticles, meanwhile, found toxicity model organisms roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans human cells.
""There risk novel technologies, careful,"" says Gustav Nyström, scientist Swiss Federal Laboratories Materials Science Technology.
Nyström points silver zinc nanoparticles bioacumulate tissues.
However, nanoparticles well encapsulated within plastic packaging, says, risk would migrate food low.Biological defenceBacteriophages – viruses kill bacteria – may another potential solution prolonging shelf life fruits vegetables making safer eat.
An American company, Intralytix, already makes bacteriophage mixes (so far available US, Canada Israel), another company, Micreos, offers bacteriophage products use leafy greens well broccoli, carrots vegetables.Bacteriophages – phages short – kill bacteria dissolving attacking cell wall, ""a bit like needle puncturing balloon"", says Gerrit Keizer, managing director Micreos.
As such, phages could potentially replace diminish use disinfectants still achieving improved shelf life.
What’s more, phages cheap, easy apply and, all, harmless humans.
""You completely covered phages.
They everywhere.
We constantly consuming them,"" says Sam Nugen, food scientist Cornell University.
Nugen predicts years, produce protected commercial phage mixes ""won't uncommon"" supermarkets.
""It’s coming up,"" says.There many methods investigation keeping fruits vegetables fresh safe eat long possible: plasma-activated water, ozone treatments, high-power ultrasound bacteriocins (antimicrobial peptides proteins produced certain bacteria) suggested.
Treating produce pulsed light, strong flashes light, keep strawberries nice firm eight days fridge, untreated ones start getting mushy.
What’s more, treatments pulsed light increase levels healthy phytochemicals fruits vegetables.Paramount emerging technologies proof safe customers, well job keeping fruit veg good longer.
Another challenge scaling things labs real life.
""You apply technologies millions millions fresh fruits vegetables, make sure uniformly, quickly cheaply,"" McClements says.In meantime, solutions food waste rather low-tech.

future,"At midnight 1 July 1982, China began mammoth undertaking.
The goal: find many people country exact moment time.
No one checked since 1964, anyone's guess would find.
After years preparations, armed 29 computers purchased task – including least 21 imported US special exemption – five million trained personnel, would spend coming months diligently counting members every household country.By October year, results in: New York Times ran headline ""CHINA, POP.
1,008,175,288: ONE-FOURTH OF THE WORLD"".
Decades growth raised country's population staggering new threshold billion people.
A baby born every two seconds.China's one-child policy introduced 1980, explicit objective reducing population growth zero.
But though ran another 36 years 2016, China entered ""negative growth"" – numbers started shrinking first time 60 years.
According data released China's National Bureau Statistics, nation home 1.4118 billion people 2022, 850,000 fewer 2021.
It reflects decline country's birth rate, falling past six years reach record low 6.77 births per 1,000 people.The change met alarm optimism – including concerns means global economy, hope continued prosperity might dependent growing population historically assumed.
The charity Population Matters suggested China's stabilising numbers celebrated potential environmental benefits welfare country's citizens.But stark demographic shift world's populous country raises many uncertainties implications future.
Is China's newly declining population really surprise?
And affect planet?
BBC Future looks five big questions get grips story.Why taken long China's population shrink?In 1991, within years one-child policy kicking in, China's birth rate fallen replacement level.
Each woman fewer children number required maintain population size one generation next.
In countries, usually around 2.1 – one woman, one partner, extra 0.1 counteract die infants.China world's largest consumer natural resources, fossil fuels, though US higest use per capita (Credit: Getty Images)In years followed, China's continued growth controversial initiative failed – counterintuitive effect known ""demographic momentum"".
This explains population constant levels mortality zero migration continue increase decades, even women fewer 2.1 children.It's time delay births deaths.
Until recently, China's population relatively youthful, average age 35 2010, compared 44.3 Germany (now 38.4).
At time, people living longer – 2021, country's life expectancy overtook US.
So, though number babies born per woman declined drastically, still babies born people dying.This changed, however.
It's thought drop fertility rates slight increase reported deaths Covid-19 pandemic may played role accelerating decline China's absolute numbers, though long anticipated.
In series, BBC Future takes look topical stories lens pressing questions - kind need ask put new development context, explain friend.Will China's drop numbers affect predictions total global population?According UN's World Population Prospects report 2022, China's population predicted decline 2023 – reduction recently revealed country's census expected time.
In fact, shift come slightly early.This milestone China's demographics already factored many projections global population growth.
Based expectation country's population would start shrink 2023, along predictions countries, UN expects total number humans planet continue expand, reach 8.5 billion 2030, peak 10.4 billion 2086.
This ""medium"" scenario, birth rates nations high fertility mellow, low fertility rates see marginal increases.India set become world's populous country year (Credit: Getty Images)""This happening China happening rest world, happen global level another 63 years,"" says Alistair Currie, head campaigns communications Population Matters.Most growth happen sub-Saharan Africa, projected contribute half population increase 2050.
The headcount region projected double time, Nigeria taking slot fourth populated country planet.According Shuang Chen, assistant professor department social policy London School Economics, focusing China's sheer numbers would missing point – though acknowledges perspective, decline might beneficial climate change.China responsible 27% carbon dioxide emitted atmosphere 2022, country currently building half new coal-fired power plants planet.
""But what's really causing concerns socially means terms structure.
Because things changing really fast… societies may time adapt,"" says Chen.

This mostly two factors: fertility rates remained high, mortality rates gone due improvements medicine.
Then there's population's age structure.
India's population around decade younger China's average, people childbearing age total.How China's fertility rate compare countries?China's fertility rate steadily declining since 1990s all-time low 1.28 2020.

Even Japan, notoriously low birth rate ageing population, fertility rate 1.34.China home several populous cities Earth (Credit: Getty Images)The steep downwards trajectory China's reproductive power thought number factors.For one thing, imbalance men women China.
The one-child policy left country skewed sex ratio: traditional preference boys, many girls aborted, abandoned even killed.
In age groups, 11 men every 10 women.
– indicating one every 11 men struggle find partner age.
Other factors thought include rising cost living, trend towards getting married later life.But also shifting values.
Survey survey revealed Chinese women view ideal number children one, two, zero, despite introduction two-child policy 2015.
These issues compounded Covid-19 pandemic, resentment lockdowns restrictions led hashtag #wearethelastgeneration trending social media.
Will China's population continue shrinking?Over past 200 years so, many industrialised countries undergone ""demographic transition"" – first growing rapid pace, population eventually transitions high birth death rates low birth death rates.
China considered ""post-transitional"" society, already completed cycle.However, less clear happen next.
China's fertility rates expected continue decline, particularly population ages fewer women child-bearing age overall.
But two big unknowns.One migration.
China's levels immigration currently extremely low, Currie explains could change country attempts grow economy.
Then there's possible impact measures government taking encourage citizens reproduce.
At moment, proving particularly effective, experts concerned may adopt coercive tactics.
""For policies reverse fertility decline challenging,"" says Chen.
""In recent years China already coming lots new measures, including getting rid one-child policy, kinds subsidies different levels.
But really working well, fertility reversed.
I think decline continue.""

future,"In late October 2022, epidemiologists infectious disease experts around world began notice unsettling trend.As epidemiologist Adam Kucharski explained Twitter thread, new wave Covid-19 afoot – going largely unnoticed.
Today alarming spikes Covid-19 deaths hospitalisations, become familiar grim days 2020 2021, replaced insidious, unrelenting succession daily fatalities.As example, let’s take figure 21 December 2022 – 133 Covid-19 related deaths England according UK government website – number may sound unremarkable compared 2020 people killed thousands virus (in week US 2,919 people died Covid-19).
But Kucharski points out, time even low levels deaths accumulate striking, perhaps even shocking number.In whole 2022, database reveals 46,099 people perished Covid-19 England – government longer recording data whole UK.
This quite 75,240 deaths 2020 74,558 2021, still might expect.
In contrast, course particularly bad influenza season, around 30,000 people UK might die flu pneumonia.Yet within corridors Westminster even newsrooms across country, ongoing deaths barely merit mention compared myriad crises agenda, cost living energy bills.
And happening UK – across globe, Covid-19 simmering away months.Scientists admit would likely take something drastic, impact new supervariant, change.
Or, Kucharski puts it, become focused peak curve comes Covid-related deaths, overlooked creeping toll fatalities still ultimately add significant number.
""We saw Delta variant 2021,"" says Kucharski.
""It sharp peak much, much longer actual overall number hospitalisations quite similar 2020.
They distributed much longer period time virus wasn’t sweeping population way,"" says.This winter, Northern Hemisphere experiencing ""twindemic"" Covid-19 flu (Credit: Getty Images)The trend seen US, 2,000-3,000 Americans still dying Covid-19 every week.
The Harvard University epidemiologist William Hanage says wrote reporters one large media organisation July last year, informing ongoing weekly death toll extrapolated full year, would equivalent three particularly devastating flu seasons.
But news longer automatically makes headlines.
""The numbers actually really quite large,"" says Hanage.
""But one things happens humans things constant become part everyday.
""Between January November 2022, 248,000 Americans died virus.
You could forgiven wondering become inured numbers, degree mortality little mundane.
""We've come really pay attention large spikes,"" says Denis Nash, epidemiologist City University New York.
""That created situation people less likely pay attention what's happening, unless there's something big reflected data.
But start look time, really scary many deaths still happening today.
""For Nash others, one frustrations many fatalities feel highly preventable.Booster hesitancyBehind endless graphs visuals government websites, surprisingly hard drill numbers fully understand still dying Covid-19.
While epidemiologists kinds demographic information work 2020 2021, budget cuts meant much difficult answer kinds questions, UK side Atlantic.For Nash, cutbacks represent grave public health error.
""If really good job profiling hospitalised dying last, five six months, could get sense who's falling cracks why,"" says.
""What we're talking even research, basic function public health missing state, local national level.
""It's thought China major spike Covid-19 cases since restrictions lifted December (Credit: Getty Images)Instead, narrative deaths really pieced together speaking doctors frontline hospitals.
According William Schaffner, professor infectious diseases Vanderbilt University Medical Centre Nashville, Tennessee, still tend vulnerable early days pandemic.
""The people we’re seeing hospitalised tend either older, younger people immune compromised, whether due illness medicine suppresses immune system,"" says Schaffner.
""It’s lot high risk groups.
""Andrew Ustianowski, consultant North Manchester General Hospital, paints similar picture.
""The deaths I could think I've involved recently people largely immunosuppressed frail, Covid therefore bigger impact,"" says.
""It also always mean died Covid.
They might caught Covid hospital, actually underlying disease killed them.
""Many doctors feel one ongoing problems makes individuals even vulnerable sluggish uptake booster vaccines, even high-risk groups.
While UK 50s anyone younger underlying health conditions qualify booster jab NHS autumn – total 26 million eligible individuals – latest statistics show half people received vaccines far.
Booster hesitancy even concerning US, 29.6% Americans 65 receiving latest dose.There many reasons trend, issues vaccine access vaccine hesitancy fostered political tensions misinformation, ""Covid apathy"", politicians general public keen move on.

)But missing booster might little impact relatively healthy individuals mostly accumulated hybrid immunity past infections vaccinations, evidence repeatedly shown vaccine-induced protection wanes rapidly vulnerable.
In March 2022, one study found immunity drops markedly among elderly care home residents three months.Scientists feel governments public health officials need ensure at-risk fully aware importance ongoing jabs.
""I would argue ongoing cost Covid less tolerating,"" says Hanage.
""We could make less, certainly United States, vaccinating people better.
Society, combination political inattention pandemic fatigue, stumbled current situation.
I know people died, unaware eligible boosters would likely saved lives.

""Boosting younger age groups make difference cutting transmission,"" says.
""That could protect someone one vulnerable groups getting Covid really bad outcome.
""In October 2022, scientists discovered new variant Covid-19 circulating New York.

As early January 2023 already spread 28 countries, outcompeted tens variants United States become one dominant, making around 28% cases.
So far, virus seem lethal competitors, however scientists concerned may continue spread globally.While antivirals Paxlovid credited reducing mortalities, rollout gone entirely smoothly.
The UK purchased 4.98 million doses antivirals end 2021, date, small fraction used, US, questions whether Paxlovid appropriately targeted towards really need it.
""Doctors sceptical whether every single person Covid antiviral, understandable,"" says Nash.
""I think used people much older – even they've vaccinated boosted, prioritised waning immunity.
Or [it used in] unvaccinated people co-morbidities.
""There also fears monoclonal antibodies – lab grown proteins supplement body’s immune system – Regeneron’s Regen-Cov Astrazeneca’s antibody cocktail Evusheld, credited saving lives many people compromised immune systems, rapidly waning effectiveness newer variants.As result, Hanage says emerging variants BQ 1.1 – subvariant Omicron variant – likely little impact population level, likely contribute steady ongoing death toll amongst vulnerable.
""It seems pretty clear monoclonal antibody therapies people need going less effective,"" says.
""And means vulnerable people going likely struggle infection viruses we're going see winter.
But minority, I think unfortunately tend discount them.
""Ongoing surveillanceIn many ways original inequities pandemic become larger longer progressed.

""By taking steps like increasing ventilation keep transmission down, easier make people highest risk continuing die Covid.
But complicated, convince whoever owns building worth doing.
""At government level, decisions made whether invest large amounts money procuring newer versions monoclonal antibodies protect minority citizens ongoing variants.Schaffner told BBC Centres Disease Control Prevention’s latest conference call, revealed ineffectiveness antibodies already becoming serious problem parts US.
But bleak reality that, again, much dilemma comes cost-benefit ratio.
Around 3% US population compromised immune systems scientists estimated likely cost around $200m (£164m) produce newer antibodies, run trials get authorised regulators.Epidemiologists warn complacent continuing understand dying virus why, likely unprepared tide shifts.
Monitoring Covid-19 never complex – sheer variation population immunity, combined rapid succession ever-evolving variants, created situation almost impossible predict new wave cases come.
Equally, becoming difficult identify one variant suddenly virulent preceded it.
This makes degree ongoing surveillance data collection important.
""With every months, seeing amount effort money that's going kind data collection going down,"" says Hodcroft.
""The question always is, make sure we've got enough data change, we'll actually able see it?
And make recommendations warnings whatever needs done.
""At time, doctors say death tragic, degree pragmatism comes impact Covid-19.
Ustianowski points many healthcare systems world ultimately limited resources, ongoing deaths virus entirely preventable vaccines antivirals administered timely manner, many deaths heart disease meningitis chronic illnesses.

The man trapped nerve arm required operation – making midline incision neck, Marsh drilled nerve wrong side spinal column.Preventable medical mistakes frequently involve wrong-sided surgery: injection wrong eye, example, biopsy wrong breast.
These ""never events"" – serious largely preventable patient safety accidents – highlight that, us learn children tell left right, everyone gets right.While people, telling left right easy telling down, significant minority – around one six people, according recent study – struggle distinction.
Even believe issues, distractions ambient noise, answer unrelated questions, get way making right choice.
""Nobody difficulty saying [something is] front back, top bottom,"" says Ineke van der Ham, professor neuropsychology Leiden University Netherlands.
But telling left right different, says.
""It's symmetry, turn around, way around, makes confusing.""
Left-right discrimination actually quite complex process, calling upon memory, language, visual spatial processing, mental rotation.
In fact, researchers beginning get bottom exactly what's going brains – much easier people others.Former US President Donald Trump briefly flummoxed leaders asked cross hands summit Philippines 2017 (Credit: AFP/Getty Images)Around one 10 people left-handed, studies twins shown genetics role play.
A study University Oxford recently revealed four regions human DNA seem play role determining someone left right handed.Those left-handed found ""mutations"" four genes code body's cytoskeleton – complex scaffolding sits within cells help organise them.
Scans people mutations showed white matter brains different structure.
The left right sides brains left-handed people also better connected right-handed people.
""Some individuals tell right left innately, without thinking,"" says Gerard Gormley, GP clinical professor Queen's University Belfast Northern Ireland.
""But others go process.""
In effort understand happens wrong-sided medical errors, Gormley colleagues conducted research medical students' experience making left-right decisions examined process.
""First all, orient right left yourself,"" says.
When answer come instantly, participants described various techniques, making L shape thumb index finger, thinking hand use write, strum guitar.
""For people tattoo body piercing,"" Gormley says.Then, figuring side someone else's left right, next step mentally rotating facing direction person.
""If I'm facing you, left hand opposite right hand,"" says Gormley.
""That idea mentally rotating object adds extra degree complexity.""
Other research shows people tend find easier judge image shows left right hand imagining hand body rotating.Research published Van der Ham colleagues 2020 found around 15% people rate insufficient comes identifying left right.
Almost half four hundred participants study said used hand-related strategy identify which.The researchers used something called Bergen right-left discrimination test dig deeper strategies work.
Participants looked pictures stick people either facing toward away them, arms various positions, identify highlighted hand left right.
""It seems simple, kind frustrating hundred quickly can,"" says Van der Ham.In first experiment, participants sat hands table front them.
""There clear effect little stick figure positioned,"" says Van der Ham.
""If looking back head, aligned you, people lot faster accurate.""
Similarly, stick person facing participant hands crossed, left hand side participant's left hand, people tended better.
""That tells us body really involved this,"" says Van der Ham.
The next question whether participants using cues body time test identify left right, referring stored idea body instead.To answer that, researchers repeated experiment, time tested four different scenarios: participants sat hands either crossed uncrossed table front them, hands either visible test, covered black cloth.But researchers found none changes influenced test performance.
In words, participants need actually see hands order use body distinguish right left.

""If kids charge finding way around, let walk front couple metres make decisions, kids ended better navigators,"" says.Research Alice Gomez colleagues Lyon Neuroscience Research Center France hints left-right discrimination something children pick quickly.

group kids shouted excitedly, I stepped car admire sun setting vast sandstone canyon Wadi Mujib.
While I stood cliff's edge, awestruck mountain ranges stretching Dead Sea, black-and-white hooded wheatear swooped near me.
I wondered something delicate could survive desolate ravines, fluttering across arid mountains building nests rock crevices.From perch, I could see narrow, serpentine road winding ridges gorges.
This route, known King's Highway, Darb ar-Raseef (""paved road"", Arabic), believed one world's oldest continuously used roads.
For millennia, merchants, pilgrims, warriors kings travelled north south Jordan's central highlands, thoroughfare served vital artery connecting ancient kingdoms empires.The King's Highway used continuously since least 8th Century BCE (Credit: Anna Stowe Travel/Alamy)Today, modern, tarmacked road (officially called Highway 35) sits atop ancient ancestor.
It runs south Syria along Jordan River, passing Roman ruins, Byzantine mosaics, Crusader castles ancient city Petra – effectively revealing history Jordan linking important historical sites.
""This route used Nabataean period [4th Century BCE roughly 106 CE], probably even that, Iron Age,"" said Fawzi Abudanah, archaeologist studied region's ancient road system.A road traversing Jordan known ""King's Highway"" mentioned Bible's Old Testament route Moses asked permission cross leading Israelites Egypt.
As Abudanah explained, since archaeological evidence showing Edomite, Nabataean, Roman, Byzantine Islamic presence along much current highway, suggests road continuous use since least 8th Century BCE.
""We keep following footsteps ancestors,"" said.According Abudanah, ancient times, King's Highway important trade route connecting Arabia, Fertile Crescent, Red Sea Egypt.
Caravans transporting incense spices Arabia took road way thriving Nabataean capital Petra.

travel,"Hiking green valleys wildflower-strewn meadows blazing sunshine, gunmetal-grey Albanian Alps towering overhead, I struck utter remoteness landscape.
Unlike Europe's famous alpine resorts, hotels ski lifts sight.
Instead, sweeping setting evoked startling sense isolation, I help feel I'd entered back-of-the-wardrobe secret land somehow evaded attention outside world.
Stretching Northern Albania southern Kosovo north-eastern Montenegro, Albanian Alps better known local Albanian (Bjeshkët e Nëmuna) Serbo-Croatian (Prokletije) names – mean ""The Accursed Mountains"".
Yet, question serrated limestone slopes got unusual moniker remains something mystery.According local legend, devil escaped hell created jagged glacial karsts single day mischief.
Some say alps' name stems woman cursed mountains trekking children scorching-hot day find water.
Others claim Slavic soldiers gave mountains name struggled march them.
In way, peaks' puzzling origin story something metaphor Albania whole.Albania filled 500,000 concrete bunkers ""the North Korea Europe"" (Credit: reidecki/Getty Images)Long called ""Europe's enigma"" book authors travel guides, Albania possibly misunderstood country Europe.
Its language semantic anomaly known relatives Indo-European linguistic family.
After World War Two, authoritarian ruler Enver Hoxha effectively sealed mountainous nation outside world four decades; banning religion (and making world's first atheist nation); forbidding travel leading Edi Rama, nation's current prime minister, say Albania ""the North Korea Europe"".
During Cold War, Hoxha convinced nation rest world wanted overthrow communist state, filled country 500,000 concrete bunkers people hide case attack.
Curiously, communist stronghold always part Eastern Bloc, since transition democracy 1991, never member European Union.
Instead, exists sort continental paradox: one three Muslim-majority nations Europe (along neighbouring Kosovo Bosnia); Albanians live outside country (roughly 10 million) (2.8 million); place yes means means yes.
For decades, travellers knew anything Albania's golden beaches, wild mountains Roman Ottoman ruins.
But years since Balkan nation cautiously opened world, wooing travellers keen discover one Europe's last wild least-explored corners.
One audacious projects recent memory Peaks Balkans: 192km circular hiking trail connecting Albania, Montenegro Kosovo series pathways straddling Accursed Mountains.
The vision cross-border project came 2013, roots go back much further.
Many Albanians Kosovars refer close relationship ""one nation, two states"", highlighted popular Albanian slogan ""jemi nje"" (we one).
In fact, 93% Kosovars ethnically Albanian speak Albanian.
Kosovo (previously part Serbia) Montenegro incorporated newly formed Yugoslavia 1918, country's breakup 1992 triggered series fierce ethnic conflicts, Serbia Montenegro mainly Christian Orthodox.
As result, hundreds thousands Kosavans fled state, many crossing Accursed Mountains Albania.
In 1999, Nato airstrikes ended war Kosovo Albanians Serbs.
Kosovo eventually independence 2008, tension along borders continued.The Peaks Balkans connects communities different faiths three neighbouring nations (Credit: Culture Exclusive/Ben Pipe Photography/Getty Images)In effort restore peace, leaders three nations suggested hiking trail linking Muslim, Catholic Orthodox communities (Serbia Montenegro one nation 2006), Albanian Kosovar hiking guides partnering Montenegrin guesthouses.
Since opening, route boosted local rural economies helped create greater connectedness far-flung enclaves.
Establishing trail meant mapping routes known shepherds encouraging farmers open guesthouses.
A final stamp approval came trail planners persuaded authorities three countries waive passport checks time free movement across borders inconceivable.
To learn more, I'd decided hike five-day, 59km section trail Albanian village Valbona village Theth.
My adventure began Albania's capital Tirana Airport, guides (Mendi Albania Agon Kosovo) tour company Zbulo greeted big smiles introduced dozen hikers Britain, Germany New Zealand formed group.
After four-hour drive north, arrived Komani Lake, vast emerald-green reservoir Drin River.
To access Accursed Mountains, boarded creaky, old ferry three-hour crossing Valbona Valley eagles soared overhead.Former shepherds farmers run many guesthouses along trail (Credit: Peter Elia)We hiked along crystalline Valbona River ancient beech forest filled sweet, wild strawberries blackberries I stopped taste.
After three hours, guesthouses came view: collection rustic huts facing Accursed Mountains, protruded skywards sharpness crocodile's tooth.
Mustafa, former shepherd, runs huts two sons, I asked gave shepherding run guesthouse.
""In former job, I many travellers walkers stay me, I never charged money.
A shepherd look animals, people too,"" said.
Later, Mendi explained Mustafa many guests staying one night persuaded change job.
So, Mustafa used savings, built huts since dedicated caring travellers full-time.
The following morning, gentle two-hour climb saw us reach summit Mount Trekufiri (2,366m).
Here, natural borders Albania, Kosovo Montenegro merged one craggy, panoramic vista.
A weather-beaten sign welcomed us Albania, within minutes, mobile phone provider welcomed Montenegro.
Today, signs indication international borders, always way.
""When I growing up, wandering mountains felt like freedom, war meant I [always] go there,"" Agon told me, crossed rushing stream fed mountains' glacial peaks.

Agon suddenly became emotional talk happened further.
This history inescapable along trail; shortly lonely path shepherds' villages, pointed memorial dedicated three members Kosovo Liberation Army killed Serbian forces.
We crossed Montenegro moss-covered rocks glacial waters Lake Hrid, still, glass-like surface reflecting spiky spruce pine trees surrounding it.
As afternoon sun dappled thistled canopy, slowly picked way downhill.
Suddenly, accommodation appeared idyllic clearing allowed us see impressive vistas Mount Bogićevića.

And small town Nakatsu considered best fried chicken Japan, quite possibly world?With added scrutiny official tasters coming play, Nakatsu City karaage shops lose prove average shop across country.
The city's entire reputation karaage capital Japan line hundreds years cultural culinary history stake.First, definition karaage (pronounced like ""karate"", except substitute hard ""g"" ""t""): type fried chicken that's famous Japan simplicity execution complexity flavours.

I know exactly find Lawson Narita International Airport, I never get plane without loading bad boys.""
There's even karaage movie produced Japan Karaage Association dubbing savoury snack ""ultimate national food"".But fundamentally, karaage final result multi-generational history spans continents, age exploration, cross-cultural pollination, famine world wars.
It's fried chicken unlike considered soul food Nakatsu.The origins karaage traced 16th Century Portuguese missionaries arrived Japanese shores Kyushu Island port Nagasaki brought fried cooking methods them.
Slowly, Japanese denizens began adopt Western ways today would considered tempura.
At time, however, Japanese diet mainly pescatarian, could attributed Buddhist beliefs.Eating chicken come picture tragedy struck island nation.
During Kyōhō era (1716-1736), widespread famine practically wiped rice crop island Kyushu killed tens thousands people.
According Livestock Production Kyushu (in Japanese), order restore finances, farmers encouraged poultry farming sell eggs eventually people began eat chicken egg-laying birds passed prime.The next major Japanese dietary jump began 1868, new Emperor Japan embarked drastic reformation society, adopting cavalcade Western ideas came industrialisation, military technology even people's diets.
Emperor Meiji opened country's borders allowed culinary influences China West permeate culture – meant eating meat.Tenkatori run Yasuhiro Fukuda, son original owner first karaage shop Kyushu (Credit: Karaage festival ExCo)But World War Two fried chicken, particular karaage, became touchstone today.
After war, Japan decimated, food shortages rampant, lack rice, Japanese diet dramatically changed.
The United States responsible importing food brought wheat led noodle-based dishes (like ramen), well broiler chickens, chickens raised meat easier faster raise cows pigs.
The island Kyushu already become known poultry centre (today half broiler chickens come Kyushu) new methods cooking meat quickly took helped nourish starving country.Karaage trace roots Chinese restaurant named Rairaiken Nakatsu City's next-door neighbour, Usa City.
It late 1950s establishment began serving deep-fried chicken karaage part set menu.
From there, jumped across street small izakaya (tavern) named Shosuke, learned frying methods Rairaiken.
The owner Shosuke originally buying chickens local farmers selling butchers wife served karaage sake eager customers.
But problem: karaage customers primarily rice farmers could pay food drinks rice harvest came in, constantly scrambling money barely surviving business.
At time, bigger farms started industrialising broiler chickens chicken-peddling business becoming less profitable.
""Shosuke quit izakaya started first take-out restaurant serving karaage.
He also switched target housewives paid cash front, instead husbands paid late drank [too much] sake,"" said Usa Karaage's US president, Yuko Yoshitake.This pivot serving karaage became major hit residents Usa immediately embraced cheap, fast delicious source protein.

Nearly every shop Nakatsu secret ingredient they're willing share separates karaage rest.Take Torishin, shop run Nakatsu's resident karaage shokunin (master) Shinichi Sumi, five-time Grand Gold Award winner Karaage Grand Prix.
Sumi spent 15 years perfecting karaage recipe.
Today, cooks every part chicken separate temperatures karaage consistently rated best Nakatsu.For perfect Kyushu Karaage Crawl, start Usa Tenkatori run Yasuhiro Fukuda son original owner Rairaiken – first karaage shop Kyushu.
From there, check Chiemi, woman-run shop helmed Yoshimi Kanbara making home 43 years uses fresh oil.
From there, head Nakatsu eat Torishin foodie's version, check Genkiya specializes chicken breasts, finally make way Kokko-ya uniquely marinated bird might best all.Then there's Takae Tateishi, one rare female karaage shop owners whose spot, Kokko-ya, arguably unique city salt-rice-malt marinade desire everything scratch.
""What I say confidence I carefully remove extra fat chicken.
I'm absolutely confident I prepare meat,"" said Tateishi, whose chicken softer texture spicier flavour fires mouth.And there's Kouji Moriyama, whose shop Moriyama first ever champion Karaage Grand Prix nephew Nakatsu karaage's founding father, Shoji Moriyama.

Since Hopewell Culture left written records, earthworks objects retrieved serve last cultural testimony.
While archaeological excavations continue sites, objects like ritual smoking pipes small stone statue shaman wearing bear skin holding human skull called ""the Shaman Newark"" found.

These staples Lithuanian cuisine; hearty meat-and-potatoes fare fill labour day.They're delicious, comforting satisfying, that's scratching surface Lithuanian cooking.
Tourists forgiven ignorance since tiny Baltic nation yet, better worse, tickle imagination travel food media large.The tragedy is: Lithuanians unaware comes culinary heritage.
But number chefs committed remembering historical national dishes serving future generations continue long process reclaiming cuisine.The fact many Lithuanians unfamiliar roots cuisine accident.
Lithuania occupied Soviet Union 1940-1990.
""It important bear mind Soviet occupation, Lithuanians nearly 50 years access history,"" explained Nida Degutiene, author book A Taste Israel: From classic Litvak modern Israeli.
(Litvak refers Jews roots historical Lithuania.)
""Our history rewritten Russians.
Any religion – Catholic, Jewish – forbidden.
""Degutiene explained baptisms, church marriages celebrating Shabbat forbidden Soviet era.
""People hiding identities,"" said.
""We knew nearly nothing roots cuisine.
""Cold beetroot soup common Lithuanian dish (Credit: Kyoko Uchida/Alamy)Chef Rita Keršulytė-Ryčkova Lokys Vilnius puts even succinctly: ""The internal policy Soviet Union, especially Baltic region, erase identity make us Soviet, Lithuanian.
""This meant spending time Russian language lessons Lithuanian ridding society intellectuals – applying approach Lithuanian literature, culture, religion gastronomy.
""There one-cuisine approach entire region without variation,"" Keršulytė-Ryčkova said.
""There list dishes made restaurants cafes, could anything list.
""Keršulytė-Ryčkova said typical Soviet menu might include Chicken Kyiv (chicken fillet pounded, rolled butter coated egg breadcrumbs); shashlik (meat skewers); meatballs made pork; goulash; borscht.Two three generations gastronomic knowledge lost time Lithuania gained independence Soviet Union 11 March 1990.
Lithuanians mistakenly conflated historical cuisine Soviet cuisine, knowledge make traditional Lithuanian dishes lost.
But chefs like Keršulytė-Ryčkova resurrecting it, creating menus tell national story many Lithuanians familiar with.But story begin?In Lithuania, there's community Romuva continue practice ancient traditions.
They're first recognise ancient roots behind many Lithuanians eat drink today.In Lithuania, Romuva making comeback approximately 10,000 members ongoing fight state recognition.Ugnius Liogė, organizes community's annual Mėnuo Juodaragis festival, met Ignas Šatkauskas, Romuva priest, snow-covered stone altar Ragutis, beer god Lithuania's ancient faith.
The medium-sized boulder sits behind encased ""eternal flame"" next Russian Orthodox Church St. Paraskeva Vilnius's well-preserved Old Town neighbourhood believed original altar stood.Both Liogė Šatkauskas discussed violent period Christianisation occurred 14th Century, considered turbulent Europe.
For many Lithuanian history buffs, bit historical trivia seen kind humble brag Lithuania held onto native traditions longer others Europe.
(Armenia first nation world adopt Christianity 301 CE followed various European kingdoms 4th 12th Centuries.
)Ultimately, however, Christianity became dominant faith, eating drinking habits borne ancient tradition remained, even many Lithuanians know it.
Kūčios, example, traditional Christmas Eve (or Winter Solstice) dinner roots ancient Romuva practice Christians adapted celebrate birth Christ.
Although practice officially forbidden Soviet occupation, Catholic families continued observe tradition secret.Lithuanian historian Andželika Laužikienė explained specific rules traditions tied Kūčios.
For example, 12 dishes represent 12 apostles.
These contain meat, milk products eggs strict fasting period.
""One taste least piece every dish,"" said, ""for prosperity next year.
""Laužikienė added Lithuanians draw straws hay underneath piece cloth see they're going live long – tradition strong roots Romuva faith.Then there's raguolis, traditional Lithuanian tree cake served special occasions, particularly Christian holidays, like Christmas Eve Easter.

Nevertheless, remain.None say Lithuania's culinary heritage stems ancient medieval times.
There centuries Christianisation country Soviet occupation.
And period relative freedom, there's plenty contemporary chefs rediscover.
According Keršulytė-Ryčkova's research, Lithuanian-written recipes exist 19th Century.
And thus, works historical references dishes ingredients found archives old books, recreating based solely description.

Lokys promised recreation historical Lithuanian cuisine find representation ancestors.
Keršulytė called interaction eye-opening, moving experience.
She admitted mistake promised next time came, would dish menu represented history.While making excuses, Keršulytė-Ryčkova explained this, too, common Lithuania.

Tourists locals flooded bars Pelourinho neighbourhood watch Brazil's first game 2022 World Cup, crowds erupted scored Serbia.
This joyous celebration, set blue skies pastel-coloured colonial-era buildings Terreiro de Jesus square, typical capital Brazilian state Bahia, Salvador de Bahia (better known Salvador).
I quickly learned celebration norm rather exception Salvador, city located along Brazil's north-eastern coast near country's best beaches, considered many birthplace modern Brazil.
Locals saying, ""Sem pressa, olha para céu, fala com Deus, você tá na Bahia"" (Take time, look sky, talk God, Bahia), which, Salvador-born Alicé Nascimento points out, embodies relaxed feel-good atmosphere unique region.
It wonder Unesco World Heritage city unofficially known Brazil's ""capital happiness"".When ask locals (known Soteropolitanos) makes Salvador jubilant, seem mention thing: axé, Yoruba West African term loosely translates ""energy"".
Jair Dantas Dos Santos, Salvador local, describes Salvador's axé ""powerful presence air, something felt rather explained"".
Indeed, Soteropolitanos say axé energy woven fabric Bahian culture, imbues everything Salvador's music laid-back attitude towards life.It impossible describe Bahian axé without first considering region's layered tumultuous history.
Salvador settled 1549 Portuguese colonialists served Portuguese America's first capital 1763.
It major seaport transatlantic slave trade considered New World's first slave market, enslaved Africans brought work region's sugar plantations.
Local teacher poet Antônio Barreto says understand Salvador's complex history, need look name given city's historical centre: Pelourinho (pillory), wooden device used subject individuals public abuse.
During colonial times, enslaved individuals publicly punished pelourinhos alleged infractions.
Today, name lingers reminder Salvador's dark past.
During slave trade era, Portuguese enslaved Africans country, transporting nearly five million Brazil.
Most enslaved individuals came Angola, another Portuguese colony, western African countries.
Slavery persisted Brazil 1888, yet Barreto explained enslaved Africans descendants continued fight freedom traditions many years.
The Bahian coat arms illustrates strength people Latin phrase ""Per ardua surgo"" (I rise difficulty).Today, Salvador considered Afro-Brazilian capital, roughly 80% residents tracing roots Africa.

Capoeira performers moved fluidly beat atabaque drums berimbau, single-stringed, bow-shaped percussion instrument originating western Africa.
Like atabaque berimbau, capoeira also traces roots Africa.
Historians believe capoeira, unique blend martial art dance, developed Brazil enslaved Africans means self-defence Portuguese control.
Today, capoeira staple Salvador street entertainment represents liberation freedom.
Practitioners say agile movements embody spirit vadiação, loosely translates loitering, exemplifies region's easy-going energy.Across Terreiro de Jesus, Barreto I found samba performance, dancers' movements synchronised beat guitars, drums pandeiros (tambourines).
Like capoeira, samba born Bahia enslaved Africans considered Brazil's national dance.
Different forms samba developed throughout Brazil colonial era, Samba de Roda hailing Salvador.
This form collective performance combining dancing, musical instruments, singing poetry drawn African Portuguese traditions.
Today, samba danced widely throughout Brazil, Salvador's Balé Folclórica da Bahia home professional performances celebrating Bahian-born dance.Samba capoeira born Bahia developed enslaved Africans (Credit: Kate Schoenbach)Bahian traditions like capoeira samba celebrated great regional pride.
In fact, Salvador's main festive season, runs December March, begins Samba Day ends Carnaval.

Perhaps nothing embodies concept axé Candomblé, syncretic religion blends Yoruba West African traditions Roman Catholicism.

In attempt preserve spiritual identity, enslaved peoples blended likeness Catholic saints African orixás (spirits).
While Candomblé generally accepted Brazilian society, practitioners, unfortunately, still face occasional discrimination.
However, Salvador, Catholic churches Candomblé terreiros (temples) coexist relative harmony, Candomblé's presence felt strongly throughout city.
Candomblé's influence particularly evident resplendent dress worn proudly Baiana de Acarajé women selling traditional street food.
Their vibrant attire emblematic Candomblé highlights blended traditions region's diverse population.
While Baiana outfits inspired European Baroque-era dress Yoruba-style clothing, multicoloured beaded necklaces represent Candomblé orixás.

Like traditions borne Bahia, Oliveira de Santana said Bahian food constitutes local identity represents ""berço Brasil"", birthplace modern-day Brazil itself.From blended arts fusion food, Salvador's traditions embody historical resilience cultural pride inextricably linked city's celebratory axé life.

But outside palace there's another story, sprawling one extends kilometres nearly impossible cover foot day.
That's bike paths come in, lining way fresh air, solitude side Louis XIV's grand vision visitors grasp.
""When go gardens, cycling... get know story Louis XIV, XV XVI,"" Mara Alfaro Prias, Paris-based tour guide, told phone.
""It's behind paintings chandeliers.
""It started 1623 Louis XIII built hunting lodge rolling countryside around small town Versailles, 20km south-west central Paris.

""So, he'll create Versailles, partially pleasure, sexuality, amazing gardens.""
Near top park's Grand Canal, tucked away cafes restaurants, there's stand visitors hire bikes.

The park air excess exclusivity, surprisingly, grounds traditionally never closed public.
The entire complex remained open, king's bedroom (as long there) gardens park.
Today, Versailles still always remains open public, access gardens park free, except select days.

And forbidden adults, bicycles allowed children age 12 – ridden winter months tourist-heavy summer.It also remarkably quiet; none screeching brakes roaring engines typical towns cities elsewhere.

In Santa Maria del Cedro, hub citron growing, visitors find specialised citron ice cream shops, bars serving citron cocktails, citron festival, stores selling citron oil, even citron museum, Museo del Cedro, recounts fruit's history sensory olfactory activities.
The fruit's sweet-yet-lemony scent also lends citron perfumes.When first visited Calabria, Noemi Disegni, president Union Italian Jewish Communities, found surprising: ""As Jew, I've always associated citron solely Sukkot festival, there's whole universe around mysterious fruit.
It cuisine recipe books, comes sole ingredient range food products, even cosmetics.

""That's trees vulnerable, need lots care experience.

""And even climate ideal citron farming, plants would stand chance without knowledge farmers.

The delicate trees need regular pruning protection nets necessary.
Farmers must always make sure leaves get enough light air, also fruits exposed direct sun, might stain skin, tree damage fruits growing branches, leaves thorns.
Also, Adduci explained, ""since plants small, farmers kneel ground order take care them.
This also adds Catholic dimension all, bit like praying.
As say, desperate fruit incomparable scent.
""If citron growing seems like intensive work, production kosher citrons adds extra layer complexity.
To certified kosher, pure, etrog needs come ungrafted plant.
Cultivating ungrafted plants means giving lots extra attention time vulnerable disease, also keeps variety pure throughout generations there's genetic mixing plants, scientists say may happen plants grafted.Once citron tree declared kosher, rabbinical inspection continues fruit, following precise rules.

worklife,"The idea four-day workweek used pipedream barely radar workers firms.
But wake Covid-19 pandemic, many companies around world given set-up go – gathered promising results.In US Ireland, six-month trial among 33 volunteer companies 2022 showed positive impact company performance, productivity employee wellbeing.
Employees working shortened week reported less stress fatigue, plus improved work-life balance satisfaction.
The 27 companies submitted final survey rated trial nine 10.In 2022 UK trial 70 firms, 86% companies said four-day week success, planned keep place pilot ended.
They cited benefits increased productivity significant financial savings employees transport childcare.
Similar trials Belgium, Spain, Japan, Australia New Zealand thrown equally promising results companies.
And – unsurprisingly – employees seem especially keen make shorter working weeks norm.Yet despite overwhelmingly positive data, four-day workweek still seems reach many workers.
Tech workers agile, forward-thinking companies might hope benefit near future, harder envisage change schoolteachers office workers traditional companies.
Ultimately, industries deeply entrenched work cultures mean four-day workweek may realistic employees – least now.Finding right fitTechnology office-based industries made greatest inroads reducing work hours far.
“It really taking notable trend areas like tech, software, ICT [internet communication technology], finance professional services – knowledge-based roles used primarily office-based, many cases hybrid remote,” says Joe O’Connor, director co-founder Work Time Reduction Center Excellence, based Toronto.
While mindset agility innovation often baked companies, also advantage terms easy, time-saving solutions.
Measures introducing meeting-free days enable employees focus purely productivity radically reduce work hours, concurrently maintaining output – something far easier nimble organisations.In sectors, shortening working week possible, requires re-thinking long-established norms.
Consulting law, instance, often organised around concept billable hour – meaning less work automatically equals less income.
But cultures change, believes O’Connor: “We're starting see examples law firms moving four-day weeks switching billing hour billing project value, reducing non-billable overheads teams focused client work.” The viability shortened workweek companies less-flexible industries may also look different other, nimble firms sectors able do.For instance, “if [these firms] close Friday give everyone day off, makes coordination clients, suppliers rest economy harder”, says Pedro Gomes, author Friday new Saturday, coordinator upcoming Portuguese government trial four-day workweek.
“The alternative give different people different days off, maintain working five days, need communication processes teams able deal days colleagues there.” As such, collaborative workplaces like advertising agencies might choose employees take day better enable team coordination, industries rely trade throughout week, like hospitality service, may establish processes salaried, non-shift workers take different days.
In way, many experts believe four-day workweek adapt suit industries.
“We seen successful examples everywhere,” adds O’Connor, “from non-profits manufacturing companies, even hospitality.”Some experts believe industries, manufacturing, may difficult time pivoting shortened workweek (Credit: Getty Images)Entrenched culture In current workplace, important predictors whether organisation likely successfully implement shorter working week may company size culture.
So far, major international companies run trials four-day workweek.Despite positive results trial Microsoft Japan Unilever New Zealand, major corporations slow follow suit.
“Large companies financial capacity make change, much rigid structures,” says Gomes.
“In practice, see small- medium companies trialling four-day workweek agile, usually CEO founder good picture would impact whole business.”In words, leaders smaller firms may less red tape deal with, find easier forecast widespread change impact company overall leaders sprawling global organisations labyrinthian, layered structures.
But companies sizes, certain type manager could also resistant changing entrenched norms – significant barrier implantation shorter weeks.
Although global movement support four-day week gathering pace, yet mainstream work practice, undertaking progressive change requires high level trust leaders workers.
If managers trust employees make success change, unlikely want even test it.
(Notably, productivity-related trust issues major problem managers throughout pandemic.)
“The biggest barrier companies introducing four-day workweeks likely combination entrenched culture resistant bosses,” says Benjamin Laker, professor Henley Business School, Reading, UK.
“Some managers may view shorter workweek reducing control, making difficult manage employees.” In words, risk-averse managers might question would shake system that’s already working.In cases four-day workweeks proven unpopular among employees, common issue reports managers intensifying performance measurement, monitoring productivity pressures.
So, although many workers cite better wellbeing areas, result added elements spike worker stress levels.
“If organisation culturally trust instead top down, centralised decision-making structure, would probably struggle make work,” adds O’Connor.Other organisations four-day workweeks likely table hourly- service-based – like restaurants, retail healthcare – shorter workweek subsequently fewer shifts ultimately means lower compensation.
Although workers industries would likely experience similar benefits reduced workloads, creating pathway less labour may impossible, means losing pay.The new normalEven facing resistance leaders, experts say likely four-day week become mainstream.
In sectors already welcoming shift, 32-hour week emerging “a tool competitive advantage terms talent, attraction retention”, says O’Connor.
“You could see scenario tech 2026, offering four-day week almost competitive disadvantage.”And companies make switch, others yet made move may feel pressure so.
“It’s hard implement four-day week rest economy organized five-day week,” says Gomes, “but moment job market coordinating four-day week, forces rest economy.” Even so, widespread societal change would take “many years”, says, industries inevitably left last.
Schools, example, might struggle implement four-day week full-time staff unless parents already working arrangements en masse.There also possibility companies turn less drastic measures four-day week.
“I predict no-meeting days, flexible work hours innovative approaches work-life balance become standard practice near future,” says Laker.For now, shorter workweek may widespread, there’s momentum around globe keep experiment going.
In 2023, trials four-day workweek planned ongoing Australia, Spain, Scotland more.“There's element ‘the genie’s bottle’.
We're going back way working pre-pandemic,” says O’Connor.
“The four-day week going 100% economy, much like five-day week wholly representative economy now, certainly could become new normal.”

worklife,"Last week, Jacinda Ardern announced would standing office New Zealand’s Prime Minister.
The 42-year-old, whose five-year term marked handling aftermath country’s worst ever mass shooting, deadly volcanic eruption Covid-19 pandemic, said 19 January longer enough “in tank” job justice.“Politicians human.
We give can, long can, it’s time,” said.
“And me, it’s time.”Though Ardern, also gave birth office, didn’t explicitly refer burnout reason decision quit politics, public media widely interpreted resignation speech reference it.
Many praised one first high-profile political leaders admit toll overwork comes responsibility running country – something particularly notable, considering reputation remaining unflappable face tumultuous period New Zealand’s history.
Some also raised prospect Ardern’s candour topic representing turning point, sorts; collective re-defining burnout something serious ­– even potentially life-threatening – syndrome, personality trait gritless millennials, lifestyle choice overachievers.
Now, many people hope words particularly might significant step towards normalising discussing mental health work: sign discussions around burnout held without fear perception stigma, turn would allow employers establish mechanisms support employees it’s late.
Yet everyone optimistic, especially women.‘Occupational phenomenon’Burnout broadly defined physical emotional exhaustion, coupled decreased motivation lowered performance work.
According American Psychological Association (APA), “results performing high level stress tension, especially extreme prolonged physical mental exertion overburdening workload, take toll”.
In 2019, World Health Organization (WHO) included burnout International Classification Diseases defined “occupational phenomenon” (while also maintaining medical condition).Burnout traditionally associated executives industries like law, consulting finance, culture presenteeism historically prevailed, often leading extraordinarily long hours overwork.
However, it’s increasingly affecting different generational cohorts, especially young people, manifesting across array sectors.Writing Harvard Business Review, author time-management coach Elizabeth Grace Saunders describes burnout generally driven factors including excessive workload, perceived lack control sense time effort put job commensurate rewards offered.Crucially, burnout gendered condition ­­– affect anyone.
Indeed, pandemic, reports burnout surged, one global survey 7,000 employees late 2020 showing upwards 90% reported experiencing form burnout.
But despite prevalence pervasiveness, business leaders, managers employees widely failed address causes consequences meaningful way.
Worse still, burnout widely stigmatised.
One study 2007 showed stigma one greatest barriers treatment mental-health challenges; another, 2020, noted perceived stigma may reflect belief people view burnt individuals less competent burnt out.Data CDC shows women likely men talk mental health seek treatment – exposing competence myth.
But even individuals speak taken seriously, mechanism resources support often don’t exist.That lack institutional support means workers may find brink – especially position walk away jobs, simply approach superiors help.‘Someone like you'Some experts believe, however, Ardern’s resignation could sign conversation shifting, leaders recognising employees’ mental health strategic priority.Experts believe several features distinguish Ardern potential catalyst unprecedented change.
First, data shows widely respected.
Even though popularity slipped recent months, leadership – much term – applauded.
The term “Jacindamania” emerged tenure indicated near-icon status global scale.Although experts say Ardern's actions could help women see her, others believe female leadership could questioned (Credit: Getty Images)Arden also widely considered relatable.
From lockdown Facebook Live broadcasts – replete toddler interruption – shows emotion impulsive gaffes, made relatability core tenet leadership style.
“It’s rare single person’s experience speak universally people create seismic shifts perception,” says Iona Holloway, Boston-based author Ghost: Why Perfect Women Shrink.
“Seeing life experiences mirrored 'someone like you' incredibly valuable.”Holloway adds Ardern’s honesty around burnout particularly affecting women, watched navigate extremely challenging years young mother public stage.Some experts also believe transparency honesty played critical role demystifying burnout.
“Burnout prevalent widely covered, it’s often talked abstractly collection signs symptoms,” explains Holloway.
“Having someone like Ardern connected topic makes real relatable people.”Ultimately, factors may well help individuals recognise admit struggling.
They may also serve reminder “that leaders talking openly personal experiences help reshape norms change cultures”, says Lorraine Hariton, CEO workplace-consultancy Catalyst.“I believe transparency authenticity communicating decision resign moves discourse towards normalising human work – level,” echoes Natasha Velikoselskiy, executive coach, organisational psychologist adjunct assistant professor business Columbia Business School.
She adds throughout tenure, Ardern modelled self-awareness confidence – two traits business leaders employees need meaningful conversation around mental health vulnerability workplace.Entrenched toxicNot everyone certain Ardern’s resignation truly going affect positive change, however.One reason sceptical may lie reality although many high-profile personalities around globe – including Arianna Huffington, Simone Biles Naomi Osaka ­– spoken burnout, needle hasn’t really shifted de-stigmatisation, increased resources workers.
That isn’t necessarily individuals speak lack credibility influence, nature burnout occurs: goes hand-in-hand toxic entrenched features many workplace cultures, like presenteeism fierce competitiveness.
And aren’t convinced characteristics distinguish Ardern role model comes sufficient truly affect change.“[Arden speaking out] opens conversation, won’t change root cause issue,” explains Adela Hussain, London-based management consultant entrepreneur.
“Most people overwork influenced culture, social policy poorly defined roles.”Some experts even question whether might backfire women’s credibility leadership.
“The danger Jacinda female leader sharing vulnerability there’s room misogynists question whether women capable high-profile leadership,” adds Hussain.Danna Greenberg, professor organisational behaviour US-based Babson College, agrees.
“I worry authenticity part high-profile women leaders fuel gender bias women strength resilience lead – particularly high-pressure situations,” says, referencing recent data showing trust women leaders fallen.“While I want believe Prime Minister Arden’s honesty might normalise conversations around mental health, I worry fact opposite simply fuel bias working mothers ascent leadership roles,” adds Greenberg.It’s also important acknowledge Ardern’s privilege.
For relatability, job rendered one world’s powerful women: status tiny minority people ever come close achieving.In words, stepping job head country entail risks quitting salaried job corporation.
Burnout often ignored suppressed fears related job security concerns showing vulnerability might lead perception unemployable.
And walking away job prioritise mental health simply economically unfeasible ­– even unimaginable – people.Still, even moment entirely transformative, may reasons optimistic could least conversation around burnout.
“Whether society large prepared see accept reality issues full complexity, I believe trailblazers like Ardern helping dismantle myths bring discourse next level transparency impact,” says Velikoselskiy.“Human leaders never meant invincible, invulnerable emotionless,” continues, “and unravelling myths highest levels power help accelerate long-overdue turn towards embracing one’s others’ humanity integral part leadership – impediment weakness.”

worklife,"Warning: This story includes details traumatic birth readers may find distressingWhen Emma Carr fell pregnant 2021, vision ideal birth.
At basic level, wanted feel empowered, listened control.
But, like many women, Carr’s vision went that.
In particular, hoped 'natural birth' – generally described vaginal delivery little medical intervention pharmacological pain relief possible.She followed two courses, including one popular approach known 'hypnobirthing', taught relaxation breathing help ease pain help stay present delivery.
And, instructors recommended, watched videos healthy, happy, non-traumatic births get right mindset.
""You watch videos babies born, beautiful,"" says Carr, 36, lives London.
“They come really easily, woman grabs them, like, 'That's what'll happen me'.
""But Carr's water broke, fluid contained meconium – foetus' stool, dangerous mother child.
After rushed hospital, doctors told get baby immediately.
Two hours later, lay operating table bright lights.
Far ideal, intervention-free vaginal birth, baby born caesarean section.
Worst all, says, unprepared felt kind outcome, given focused – encouraged courses followed – creating positive mindset.
""If I head 'should' gone, I feel like failure,"" says.
""I wish [my instructors] bit open births happen.
That always go right, hypnobirthing.""
While pregnant, Carr says friends tried warn might labour hoping for.
But dismissed them, thinking probably gone mindset techniques would.
""People would normally listen to, stop listening to, got people head telling birth natural magical, body perfectly designed it,"" says.
""But I think mine was.
""Many women benefit approach birth.
Some even experience ideal scenario hoped for.
With right techniques – like breathing, listening affirmations massage – advocates say birth enjoyable, even orgasmic.
But others, like Carr, left reeling, traumatic birth – feel fixated vision, preparing many ways might happen, made experience even worse.Birth movementFor much history, women frequently died labour – often one every 100 births 1600s 1700s.
Scientific advances including antibiotics mean maternal mortality rate plummeted.
As medical community expanded focus beyond safety, narcotic pain reduction techniques like epidural became common many countries.
Even today, maternal mortality highest countries might adequate medical care complications easily treated elsewhere.After preparing 'ideal' birth experiences, women feel they've failed end medical intervention, like C-section (Credit: Getty Images)Many birthing parents choose modern pain-management right choice them, many doctors also recommend it.
But women health practitioners believe birthing process gone far direction, saying over-reliance medical interventions unnecessary, risky, even dehumanising.
In 1960s, example, women wealthy countries often gave birth sedated general anaesthesia.
They may felt pain, feel present make in-the-moment decisions regarding care, either.
Today, many women strive – idealise – often referred 'positive birth'.
Coined UK birth campaigner Positive Birth Movement founder Milli Hill, term 'positive birth' wasn't, originally, meant describe particular kind labour.
It broadened.
""A positive birth 'natural' 'drug free' – simply informed place positivity opposed fear,"" association's website reads.
""You birth positivity hospital home, without medical intervention.""
Rather, website outlines, experience woman feels ""freedom choice, access accurate information, control, powerful respected"" well one ""goes enjoy, later remember warmth pride"".
Still, many women follow positive birth courses say feel undercurrent idealising 'natural' births particular.
For instructors, big part emphasising birth 'positive' comes talking woman's body 'designed' give birth – subtext medical interventions impede, rather assist, process.A main tenet many approaches, example, fear anxiety increase body's production hormones like adrenaline, slow labour make contractions feel worse.
With techniques including making one's birth space feel homey comfortable; supported birth partner (or team); using breathing meditation techniques; and, all, going labour feeling relaxed confident, idea encourage production oxytocin instead, making labour faster less painful.
The popularisation 'natural' birth particular long history: dates back least 1930s, interestingly around time first college obstetrics gynaecology founded.
And many women, approaches like never held much weight: want give birth painlessly possible, use every modern medical intervention drug available?But others, image 'natural' ideal birth stuck, amplified booming birth-education industry.
On social media, beautiful stories relaxed water births soothing music candles everywhere abound.There many benefits birth movements, least aims put decision-making back birthing parent's hands.
But 'positive' 'natural' increasing common cultural ideals, women, downside.
No number classes relaxation techniques always overcome reality circumstances every birth different; huge racial ethnic disparities quality care; maternity care subpar overall; women sometimes feel pressured accept interventions.
Even simplest goals feeling empowered labour, fond memories birth, feel reach.
(It's also worth noting time financial investment courses require make reach many – cost less $50 (£41) online upwards $1,000 [£815] private guidance, usually require least several hours instruction).Proponents approach say medical providers need step fix problems, rather mothers lowering expectations.
But meantime, women whose labours don’t go planned, highly specific – often idealised – birth vision mind put undue pressure is, ultimately, unpredictable experience.
In worst case, feel failed – babies.
An ideal – norm The 'natural' birth, everything unfolds perfectly without need intervention, remains far norm.
In US 2020, example, CDC data shows nearly third births included induction labour.
In addition, third caesarean deliveries (C-sections).
Home births, often held ultimate 'natural' labour, accounted 1% births.But many birthing parents emphasise natural birth goal 'positive' approach, labours always go plan – ripple effects.
Some mothers say that, focusing ideal birth, blindsided reality – felt additional grief getting experience perfect birth wanted.
In one study, 15% women unplanned C-section reported felt though they’d ""failed"".Edwina Moorhouse considers 'positive' birth convert smooth birth experiences three children (Credit: Courtesy Edwina Moorhouse)This article part BBC’s Family Tree series.
Explore Amanda Ruggeri, including in-depth looks motherhood ambivalence new mums expected ‘bounce back’ quickly.In Toronto, Andie Perris, 38, wanted ""as much natural experience possible"" first birth.
She took hypnobirthing course, listened relaxation audio tracks read Ina May Gaskin's On Childbirth, ""full stories serene deliveries women breathing babies body taking over"", says.
""I seen heard beautiful birth stories, that's I expecting I done work,"" says.
""I really believed would change outcome delivery.""
Instead, Perris labour almost 24 hours.
Her pelvic floor ""completely destroyed"".
Her son, descending properly, ultimately delivered vacuum.
Perris postpartum haemorrhage.Looking back, says, probably C-section.
But set it.
""Feeling like one 'right' way baby, made laser focused right way,"" says.
""And course, there's one right way.
But I wrapped vision nature 'intended' baby.
""Because focused maintaining positive mindset going labour, Perris says, didn’t prepare possibility might go differently.
As result, ""when things started go sideways, hard adapt"".For second child, tried listen relaxation audio tracks she'd used prepare first.
She found anxiety inducing stop.Emiliana Hall UK-based doula founder The Mindful Birth Group, helps women prepare birth.
Hall, says approach eschews idealising form labour instead covers potential outcomes, reports seeing wave second-time mothers saying that, 'positive' birth approach, first experience go thought.The problem, says Hall, negative experience.
It's blame it.
This risk approach focuses much mindset, says: many courses recommend listening positive birth stories, even replacing negative words like ""contractions"" ""surges"", keep fear anxiety, therefore stress hormones and, theoretically, pain, bay.
If woman wind feeling pain trauma, might question relaxed enough.
""When work, feels like either failed, complete waste time,"" says Hall.
""But many things can't control.""
In courses, says Hall, careful even use phrase ""positive birth"" – despite teaching techniques make birth better, acutely aware there's guarantee things go planned.
'I can't lucky three times, right?'
Of course, plenty mothers found positive birth approaches helpful, even transformative.In Berlin, Edwina Moorhouse, 32, thought sounded ""hippie"".
But watching YouTube vlogger enthuse experience, put aside scepticism.
""I really wanted joy see has,"" says.
She took hypnobirthing course, practised breathing techniques underwent weekly acupuncture.
She smooth, fast water birth.
Her second labour similar.
By third child, dragged pink Himalayan salt lamps, big headphones warm socks hospital room make cosier, convert.
""I can't lucky three times, right?
There must something this,"" says.
""To think third son, I religiously listening hypnobirthing mp3s, flooding brain positive stories YouTube, spending stupid amount money one shampoo scent offered instant pain relief – I completely unrecognisable woman pregnant six years ago.""
Indeed, evidence techniques taught many birth courses reduce pain epidural use, lessen number interventions length labour itself, lower C-section rates, improve mother's overall birth experience.
But findings always replicated, aspects seem useful others.
One large review showed although popular elements, like presence trained birth partner using music massage relax, helped reduce likelihood woman would look back birth experience ""negative"", techniques less useful.Another review showed music, yoga relaxation techniques like guided meditations might help reduce pain.
But made difference lowering rates birth interventions including C-sections, whether women ultimately needed pharmacological pain relief.From medical standpoint, generally accepted that, since intervention risks costs, done unnecessarily or, case pain-management interventions, without full, informed consent.
An epidural, example, may linked longer second stage labour higher chance needing instrumental birth and, rare cases, fever nerve damage.
But women follow 'positive' birth approaches say undertone sometimes go that, making birthing parents feel intervention ""bad"".
""The message made it, natural, women since dawn time, body knows doing, baby knows doing,"" says Beth Sandland, lifestyle blogger founder digital magazine The Motherhood Edit.
""I say fear mongering.
But I would say definitely undertone of, 'the hospitals necessarily act best interest.
The doctors necessarily realistic approach physiological birth'"" courses social-media accounts seen, says 26-year-old.For many, important aspect 'positive' birth comes one thing: autonomy (Credit: Getty Images)Yet interventions alone necessarily ultimate arbiter 'positive' experience.
Indeed, research found one important aspects whether woman thought birth positive long labour took.
Those shorter labours satisfied – even labour shortened intervention like, say, oxytocin augmentation.
Given effect prolonged labour, researchers concluded, ""interventions avoid could result 'net benefit'"".
For many women, course, interventions also lifesaving.
""How presented like, tell you.
And like doctors kind get you, way,"" says Carr.
""They're like, 'Oh, risky.
It's natural.'
That true, always.
I think me, risk.
If I medical intervention, one us might survived … I think wild I would birthed baby easily.
""'I studied like exam' A big part positive birth movement involves empowerment.
Indeed, feeling control involved decision-making big part positive experience.
And even complications delivery, women still find certain techniques help feel control useful.
In Glasgow, Anna Murray, 34, preparation possibly could labour.
""I studied like exam,"" says.
She private course doula, read books, followed yoga hypnobirthing course.
She even Google Drive folder audio tracks yoga videos different birth positions.In end, needed unexpected caesarean – son grown big fixed position amount exercises could turn.
But breathing techniques helped stay calm operating table, says.
""It help calm controlled birth whatever have.
But ultimately, can't really give control what's going happen,"" says.Murray's birth speaks nuanced nature many women experience positive birth ideal today.
For some, pans exactly dreamed, gives techniques help make happen.
For others, crushing disappointment.
And like Murray, techniques provide useful tools make best difficult situation.Ultimately, many, important aspect positive birth comes one thing: autonomy.

worklife,"Matthew middle-management role online education centre seven years.
Having awkward conversations everyday part job.“I often end begging sweet-talking teachers cancel plans time off, cover: ‘I know tomorrow day off, we’re really short-staffed’,” explains.
“I put really difficult spot, especially towards end month we’re approaching sales targets.”Originally hired English teacher, Matthew, withholding surname job-security concerns, thrust supervisory role Taiwan-based company asked create Japanese-language department.
“I majored Japanese, that,” says.
“I began training recruiting employees, reporting back supervisors boss.
I wasn’t given training: I learn ropes job.” Matthew one many mid-ranking bosses somewhere top bottom organisation.
They’re often pushed leadership execute business goals, pulled employees may different expectations needs.
“I don’t know I’m unpopular, I occasionally put foot – leave people annoyed disappointed fill ton shifts.”In many cases, high-performing employees simply end supervisory roles default next step career ladder.
Sometimes, receive little training organisational support promotion.
These in-between managers face pressure executives lower-level colleagues, find feeling powerless ill-equipped satisfy everyone’s demands.
Because this, middle managers frequently cast villain: bureaucratic, ineffective ‘yes-man’ embodies corporate dogma.Realistically, however, bosses aren’t actually trying make workers’ lives miserable.
Instead, they’re caught difficult place, manage team’s requests, personalities workloads, also attempting hit goals satisfy bosses.
Deconstructing mythMiddle managers crux organisation, sitting natural point tension executives employees.“It’s responsible making strategic imperatives organisation happen,” says Jim Link, chief human resources officer Society Human Resource Management (Shrm), based Virginia, US.
“They’re expected execute tasks set organisation, often committed shareholders.”Alongside pressure bosses, supervisors usually first field employee requests like holidays, flexible working pay rises – therefore first reject needed.
Matthew agrees hardest aspect middle manager managing people – organisation.
“You end person standing way employee’s next vacation, sister’s wedding,” says.
“Not need know manage colleagues, also need learn manage people you.”This friction create conflict mid-ranking bosses workers manage.
“Their job responding demands competing stakeholders, necessarily aligned one another,” says Christopher Kayes, professor management George Washington University School Business, based Washington, DC.
“It means middle manager unmanageable.”Tasked ensuring workers jobs effectively, middle managers often seen envoy company’s big bosses, rather employees lead, adds Kayes.
“One employee told they’d never go management would mean they’d act unethically.
The narrative managers part ‘system’: could individual trying best fit leadership goals within day-to-day organisation might considered set unethical behaviours employee.”“In effect, serve multiple masters: superiors set goals, working helping accomplish tasks,” adds Link.
“The construct little damning middle managers.”Experts say reality middle managers they're much stress reports – (Credit: Getty Images)Stark contrastsFor reasons, middle management hard job: mid-ranking bosses expected juggle vast organisational issues catering people conflicting agendas – trying get tasks done meantime.
It’s role made tougher fact they’re often left without support resources thrive.Employees, highly adept technical role, promoted management without necessarily required skills.
“In tech, someone could excellent coder rewarded promotion middle management,” says Kayes.
“However, coding abilities won’t help them.
Instead, need know coordinate team, motivate influence others – completely different skillset versus technical expert.”Many employees promoted supervisory positions don’t receive training soft skills like emotional intelligence empathy, might unintentionally stoke tensions among junior workers whenever issue arises.
“It’s expensive takes years develop employee effective manager,” says Kayes, “and companies focused immediate results.”The focus middle manager’s direct reports, however, almost entirely people skills.
In August 2020 survey 457 US workers SHRM, 84% said poorly trained people managers created much unnecessary work stress.
Workers cited effective communication (41%), developing training teams (38%) managing team performance (35%) areas managers could improve upon.Of course, every manager perpetually unprepared, companies provide management training.
And many managers expected learn job – something Matthew says he’s able do.
“I’ve received organisational support – it’s ultimately fast-moving environment, it’s hard company keep teaching you,” says.
“Nearly myself, trying things learning mistakes.”However, even supervisors able improve skills experience, new shape workplace moulded Covid-19 pandemic posed novel challenges, often create friction.
Many middle managers underprepared demands remote- hybrid working.
In changed world work, supervisors often relying old practices, say experts.
“A leader needs apply skillset completely new way, without teams physically present,” says Link.
“The expectations managers different following Great Resignation, alongside evolving labour-market trends mental-health crisis among workforce.” This means middle managers – already difficult place nature jobs – may struggling keep things together even before.Additionally, Kayes says managers also unfairly omitted conversations around burnout following pandemic.
“Managers often treated separately workforce, yet experience issues – perhaps even worse aren’t supervisory roles.
Their job recipe stress anxiety.” And unless managerial positions filled employees strong people skills, organisations invest leadership training, narrative frames middle managers villains likely continue.Kayes says issues like ongoing hiring crisis, difficulties leading hybrid teams dealing flexible working requests created unsolvable problems managers fix; bereft organisational support, instead face wrath junior employees.
“We’ve never scenario it’s difficult hire retain workers, increasing employee demands adds challenge.
Most organisations aren’t equipped policies procedures deal requests – let alone middle managers.” It might time cut office’s resident bogeyman slack: middle managers, all, often much less powerful might appear.
Some empathy collegial goodwill could help make everyone’s work lives bit easier.
“It’s asked responsible things run,” says Kayes, “yet don’t necessarily authority resources control, fix change longer-term problems.”

This particularly dank dull London January, mood already low, repetition weekly deadlines start feel exhausting.
I feel like I’m never-ending treadmill – I want jump off.I’m hardly alone: recent trend ‘quiet quitting’ revealed, many people losing enthusiasm careers loved.
You may done everything within power attain perfect job, yet daily grind sometimes saps enthusiasm.
“In experience coaching clients, I would say big issue, problem growing,” says Anna K Schaffner, life coach UK, specialises exhaustion, burnout resilience, author The Art Self-Improvement.For some, loss passion may sign need change careers – drastic move always possible.
Fortunately, recent studies show people naturally apply “cultivation strategies” reignite passion motivation – many ways apply techniques.
A matter mindsetThe first study comes Patricia Chen, professor psychology University Texas Austin, US.Chen’s previous research examined influence two different mindsets passion.
So-called “fit theorists” likely endorse statements as:The “develop theorists”, contrast, likely agree statements as:Using detailed questionnaires measure people’s mindsets various workplace outcomes, Chen found beliefs become self-fulfilling prophecies.

From hundreds responses, researchers identified five common strategies students claimed raised motivation.

The students fit mindset, contrast, seem employing strategies effectively.Making motivationChen’s findings chime broader psychological research looking ways people regulate interest motivation work.
Besides confirming use strategies Chen identified – identifying personal societal relevance work – studies suggest ways reviving mojo.

“This especially effective use little rewards achieving goals watching Netflix, you’ve completed assignment,” says Maike Trautner, post-doctoral researcher University Münster, Germany.
That’s self-consequating part.Once again, mindset matters.
In recent study Malte Schwinger, professor Philipps University Marburg Germany, Trautner surveyed 700 students ways handle motivation.
Just Chen observed work passion, found students believe motivation task fixed unchangeable, others believe cultivated.
And latter mindset look ways build motivation using practical strategies, believed motivation beyond control less proactive.
Taking actionFor people already develop mindset, strategies may seem obvious.

“Good employers interested supportive idea: makes perfect sense employees given tasks suited perform well,” says.If still feel like rut, might simply asking much career.
In much way might expect romantic partners generate excitement life – puts unnecessary pressure relationship – sometimes unrealistic expectations jobs provide meaning lives.For reason, Schaffner suggests taking hobby could also give sense purpose achievement, job place find satisfaction life.

worklife,"As 2022 comes close, we're bringing back favourite pieces year.
See rest Best Worklife 2022 collection great reads.“The first [several] years marriage amazing sex life … got older (he’s 30 now), seem interested sex anymore.”This one many comments floating around r/DeadBedrooms subreddit social-media platform Reddit – self-described “discussion group Redditors coping relationship seriously lacking sexual intimacy”.
Frustrated anecdotes like abound people low- zero-sex relationships.
“Why prefer hand sex me?” one poster asks.
The subreddit’s outlook relatively bleak: “Advice always appreciated,” reads description, “just surprised we've heard all.”While may seem natural enough stories come older couples struggling retain spark decades earlier, many posted people self-identify late 20s 30s.
Some say children marriages put halt sex lives; others say “low-libido” husbands watch endless pornography, yet won’t get aroused them.
The list grievances continues throngs millennials posting ‘dead bedrooms’.Although millennials around sexual prime, members generation around world reportedly “retreating sex”.
Accounts millennials forums including r/DeadBedrooms corroborate this, especially married long-term couples.
Some recent statistics tell similar story: 2021 survey adults ages 18 45 across US, conducted Kinsey Institute Indiana University sex-retailer Lovehoney, showed among married adults, millennials likely “report problems sexual desire past year”.
The survey showed 25.8% married millennials reported problem, 10.5% married Gen Z 21.2% married Gen X adults reported same.Although “low desire isn’t necessarily synonymous sexless marriage”, says Justin Lehmiller, research fellow Kinsey Institute, “when one partners marriage experience drop-off desire sex, sexual frequency usually declines – loss desire one biggest reasons marriages become sexless first place”.What, exactly, going on?
Sex therapists researchers suggest variety factors may explain millennials’ sexless marriages, current life stages almighty influence internet.
Regardless specific reasons causing sexual fractures bedroom, overwhelmingly, generation facing unique – even unprecedented – obstacles healthy sex lives.Many millennials children, prime disruption sexual desire (Credit: Getty Images)The anatomy sexless marriageThere multiple definitions sexless marriage.
One literal: couple sex long period time.
Another widely used measure sexless marriage sex fewer 10 times year.Experts spoke BBC Worklife also varying ideas.
New York City-based sex therapist Stephen Snyder says, “I usually think ‘sexless’ four times year less,” unless couple “having sex quarterly say awesome”.
Kimberly Anderson, sex therapist assistant professor psychiatry UCLA's School Medicine, puts rate ‘low-sex’ marriage fewer 25 times per year.
Others say definition purely subjective; couple unhappy frequency they’re sex, there’s problem worth addressing.
Many factors lead sexless low-sex marriage.
If there’s “desire discrepancy”, California-based sex therapist Christene Lozano puts it, imbalance grow time couple doesn’t good job addressing it.
The person wants sex keeps initiating might give lose self-esteem continue get rejected, instance.
Meanwhile, partner rejecting might feel increasingly guilty, altogether creating even worse conditions fostering arousal.Other factors including medical mental-health issues also contribute, make sex impossible, painful, difficult undesirable.
Busy lives, work and/or children, remove sex equation, too, poor communication partner’s desires.Although aspects contributing sexless marriages aren’t particular generation, experts noticed shift who’s experiencing sexless relationships, periods lives.“It’s become shorter amount time [couples] become sexless,” believes San Francisco-based sex therapist Celeste Hirschman, who’s seeing clients 20 years.
Anecdotally, used see take around 10 15 years couples stop sex other.
“Now, it’s maybe taking three five,” says.Anderson, who’s working sex therapist 30 years, says demographics sexless marriages indeed changed since started practicing.
“Thirty years ago, majority couples I treated sexless marriage 50-plus,” says, struggling decreased libido hormonal changes illnesses come aging.Today, however, couples sexless marriages Anderson sees 45 younger.
“The underlying dynamics quite different were/are older couples,” says.The weight stressToo much stress get way anyone’s sex life – millennials especially riddled cortisol.
“Stress one biggest libido killers,” says Lehmiller, “and millennials particularly stressed group many ways, especially compared Gen X.”Major life stages one factor.
Many millennials age they’re becoming new parents young children, overwhelming time people’s lives.
In 2018 study UK-based counselling network Relate, 61% people 30s reported less sex they’d like “young children way”, 31% saying they’ve “lost libido since children”.
Other generational struggles also feed stress; millennials already behind prior generations meet life milestones, like buying homes; now, spiking prices proliferation student debt straining millennials, especially financially.But all, current state workplace driving stress.
May 2022 data global consulting firm Deloitte, collected across five countries, revealed 38% millennials reported massive mental-health burden, especially women (41%) versus men (36%), largely driven work anxiety.The working environment never particularly stable low stress millennials, course.
“For example, many millennials started careers Great Recession,” says Lehmiller.
But added burden Covid-19 pandemic brought strife.“During times great technological change, people tend work extremely hard,” adds Snyder.
And data shows, millennials particularly workaholics.
Overwork often leads exhaustion, lead couples repeatedly tired sex end long day – pattern experts say endure repeated regularly.
And worries around financial stability exacerbating problem.
“Greater financial concerns coupled higher baseline rates depression anxiety could particularly potent combination producing high stress low sexual desire,” says Lehmiller.Some experts report rise easily accessible pornography image-driven social media interrupting intimacy (Credit: Getty Images)Social media, pornography declining sex livesThe influence internet also can’t overstated.
Snyder describes social media “distraction” physical interpersonal activities like sex, Hirschman believes role contributing sexless marriages goes much deeper.
She says it’s led increased “image consciousness” among millennials – first generation really conscripted heavy social-media use.
People feel need present perfection platforms, says, filters touch-ups aren’t available real life.
The resulting self-consciousness follow people bedrooms marriages, making less body confident.
Per Relate’s 2018 data, 37% people younger 30 low-sex partnerships reported self-consciousness bodies, 14% 60 older said same.In addition social media, experts agree porn outsized influence millennials, many came age porn becoming widely accessible online.
This, course, huge shift previous generations.
“In 20th Century, guys tended sexually compulsive lots women,” says Snyder.
“These days, tend watch lots porn.” In words, don’t seek sex another person sexual experience involves people, even people video.Anderson many younger-than-45 male clients sexless marriages suffer “porn-induced erectile dysfunction”, says – condition makes either impossible difficult achieve erection without pornography real-life partner.
This lead preferring solo sex sex partners.
Some get used total control pleasure, explains, extreme images see porn married sex can’t live to.
""‘Porn never rejects me’ ‘Porn never criticises performance’ common comments office,” says Anderson.‘Dead bedrooms’ forever?
Of course, millennials can’t change entered workforce recession reeling another one.
They can’t erase influence porn social media.And clear lack sex topic people find hard even talk person sharing bedroom, let alone broadly – making understanding issues finding solutions even harder.

And ADHD mostly manageable university, effects ramped got workforce.
It’s held back ever since.Global data 2020 estimates rate adult ADHD 2.58% (yet many people remain undiagnosed, especially minority communities).
This means millions experience hurdles like Christian’s – don’t even know why.
But even people label struggles, diagnosis isn’t necessarily fix; many workers ADHD experience challenges inhibit success.
And whether reveal issues managers keep private, effects ADHD follow around careers, affecting job security, career options, work relationships even feel themselves.Yet ADHD diagnoses tick up, awareness – help contextualise workers’ struggles colleagues employers, potentially illuminate new pathways support.Some workers ADHD find hard get started, differences like send self-judgement spiral (Credit: Getty Images)More ‘kids fidget’ADHD oft-stereotyped ‘squirmy’ kids people get distracted easily, says Texas-based Tracy Winter, executive leadership coach Nerd Coach, specialises neurodiversity.
Instead, ADHD complex neurodevelopmental disorder, manifests diverse symptoms behaviours (though word ‘disorder’ controversial, points Winter, also ADHD; prefers look “different kind brain”).
The ADHD brain isn’t necessarily flighty, explains – anatomically, structurally looks different functions differently.
People ADHD experience effects diversely, says Henry Shelford, chairperson co-founder charity ADHD UK, there’s way know it’ll appear someone’s life.
Some struggle time, keep desk looks like something exploded, instance; others neat pin always punctual, yet can’t stop interrupting conversation.
Some people, says Winter, tend they’re interested – “what lights brains” – causes de-prioritise urgent tasks.Its effects workplace particularly acute, norms around behaviour processes drive bosses label ADHD employees lazy, disengaged incapable.
“ADHD traits really badly misinterpreted,” says Shelford.
“If I struggle timeliness, you’re going think I don’t care job.
If I forget something, might conclude I’m dumb.” Beyond bosses’ perceptions, often, workplace struggles make workers ADHD judge themselves, too, causing damaging emotional impacts.Rebecca Phillips Epstein, television writer essayist recently diagnosed ADHD, struggled constantly early career show meetings prepared time well hit deadlines.
The issues compounded climbed career ladder.
And could usually manage fly, says felt terrible constantly existing edge failure.
“As I got older, world got bigger… I started slip, I started struggle,” explains Epstein, 37.
Epstein felt “should able everyone else do”, wound “torturing” herself, balancing perfectionism feeling incapable performing expected.
Christian, too, himself, despite knowing he’s neurodivergent (someone whose brain differences affect brain works).
“There’s whole element shame guilt,” says.
“[Your behaviours] start close doors opportunity, doors shut … When I forget stall something last minute, I start go spiral.

Why can't I person could do?’”This self-judgement one problematic knock-on effects send people ADHD negative emotional states.
“There element of, like, ‘why bother, I'm going right?

This trigger common reaction “rejection sensitivity dysphoria” , says “is much deeper feeling rejection critique” – one erode self-confidence emotional wellbeing.
And although rejection sensitivity unique people ADHD, exacerbated people condition.The problem ‘masking’Often, people ADHD uneasy asking help, means announcing diagnosis.The stigma ADHD still present – viewed condition children, something isn’t much challenge.
“There plenty people still believe ADHD,” says Winter.
This lead scepticism idea people’s brains function differently result.Many workers instead engage “masking” compensate.
“It’s idea ‘who I need present accepted?’ … restraining oneself lot natural impulses” fit colleagues, says.
Masking effective short period time, rarely sustainable often depleting.
“It’s almost like minimising identity conform social norms … It’s uncomfortable, it’s exhausting, enough, lose track behind mask.”Some workers ADHD choose keep diagnoses struggles secret fear judgement, means can't get accommodations need (Credit: Getty Images)For workers come forward diagnoses, however, conversation risky.
In situations, asking accommodations – like fewer meetings different working hours – may spur bosses colleagues view difficult work with, cut workflow team.That’s Kim To found worked finance London early 20s – position thought dream job.

Forward stepsWorkers ADHD almost always challenges workplace, even able work understanding accommodating bosses, get assistive tools request.
But things may looking up, least part.
As ADHD diagnoses increased past decade, Sheldon says knowledge enabled people seek help employers.
Some managers may also open due rising awareness – cases, see diagnoses within families, says Winter.Plus, pursuit accommodating workplace unlikely hero: Covid-19.

worklife,"When marketing manager Eliza returned holiday, received email boss asking arrive work early next day.
“I instantly feared worst,” explains.
“I knew job wasn’t best fit.
I’d probation previously extended; expectation weekend working post-work drinking didn’t suit me.
I thought he’d used time opportunity fire me.”However, Eliza arrived boss’s office, wasn’t immediately let go.
Instead, informed company restructure – job description completely rewritten.
Someone else would take tasks, would expected work remotely new admin role.
In weeks followed, Eliza’s professional life became much quieter.
Instead formulating London-based events agency’s marketing strategy office attending live shows part remit, main duties consisted simply available 0900 1800, sending occasional email completing odd routine task home.
Eliza effectively frozen employer.
Barely month later, quit.
“It humiliating – I made feel worthless,” says.
“It worst experience career: I’d rather fired spot paid go that.”There may always good fit jobs workers hired them.
In cases, companies bosses may decide want worker depart.
Some may go formal channels show employees door, others may Eliza’s boss – behave way employee chooses walk away.
Methods may vary; bosses may marginalise workers, make lives difficult even set fail.
This take place weeks, also months years.
Either way, objective same: show worker don’t future company encourage leave.
In overt cases, known ‘constructive dismissal’: employee forced leave employer created hostile work environment.
The subtle phenomenon nudging employees slowly surely door recently dubbed ‘quiet firing’ (the apparent flipside ‘quiet quitting’, employees job, more).
Rather lay workers, employers choose indirect avoid conflict.
But so, often unintentionally create even greater harm.The path least resistanceFor myriad reasons, bosses long tried nudge workers perceive underperforming bad cultural fit door.
“This happening workplaces decades,” says Christopher Kayes, professor management George Washington University School Business, based Washington, DC.The reasons complex.
If workers behave ways violate contracts, example, companies terminate employment.
But bosses simply dislike workers, see middling mediocre performers, taking action remove complicated, often requiring lengthy processes involving performance management programmes multiple warnings.“Companies usually reluctant let worker go,” says Kayes.
Firing leads “immediate sense sides created” which, worst, land company court worker contests it, potentially generating negative headlines working environment.
“It’s often easier simply let underperforming employee stay job go process firing potential litigation.”Employers often don’t want expose risk conflict, adds Suzanne Horne, partner employment law legal firm Paul Hastings, based London.
“Subtly encouraging someone leave seen easier option.
If employee eventually resigns, it’s ‘no-fault approach’: severance doesn’t need paid, conflict avoided parties ultimately happy.”Managing perceived poor performance, working employee improve output turning useful resource company would alternative way deal problem.
However, Kayes says bosses often ill-equipped this, whether lack time training.
“Organisations tend bad preparing leaders take responsibilities they’ll need job.
So, often find without resources need effective deal employee underperformance.” In situation, firing seen last resort managers unable – unwilling – turn employee want be, often follow path least resistance: quiet firing.
“Much ultimately avoidance behaviour comes procrastination: managers cases wanting avoid difficult conversations,” points Kayes.
“Ironically, worry firing worker reflect poorly them, quietly fire instead.”To push workers, managers may sometimes set workers fail impossible tasks, take away jobs altogether (Credit: Getty Images)Why often backfires By engaging quiet-firing behaviours, managers likely playing long game.
In theory, it’s low risk minimal effort; hope withdrawing support, worker soon realises don’t future company moves elsewhere.However, approach collateral damage.
The tactic means firms managers end saddled workers don’t want, leading managers engaging behaviours often seen passive-aggressive, says Kayes.
“You stop offering employee opportunities advance; stop inviting certain meetings; stop providing important work feedback.” There also risk creating ‘us them’ mentality, potentially harming workers targeted quiet firing.
“You engaged employees, quietly left there, sometimes without knowledge,” says Horne.
“It doesn’t create inclusive high-performance workplace culture.” Quiet firing affect firm’s reputation, too, even worker departs without apparent conflict; employees may well share experience online review.
“There’s greater awareness employment rights today,” says Horne.
“People willing call workplace issues, especially following pandemic.” An employee subtly nudged door without legal recourse, either.
“If look individual aspect quiet firing, there’s likely nothing serious enough prove employer breach contract,” says Horne.
“However, there’s last-straw doctrine: one final act employer which, added together past behaviours, asserted constructive dismissal employee.”More immediate though, mental-health cost worker deemed expendable employer – never directly informed.
“The psychological toll quiet firing creates sense rejection outcast work group.
That huge negative impact person’s wellbeing,” says Kayes.
Eliza agrees.
“I made feel worthless useless quietly fired,” says.
Now happily employed elsewhere, she’s realised experience “was reflection terrible boss, rather me”.
But people experience quiet firing longer term, insidious ways, may see things clearly.“Over time, employee may figure something isn’t right one-to-one meetings always cancelled, manager never makes time talk development performance they’re always overlooked promotion,” says Horne.
“They face daily drip feed employer trying make resign – it’s absolutely gruelling.” 'A self-fulfilling prophecy'Quiet firing may easiest option table bosses – especially remote-work world, excluding employees even easier – it’s good solution firms workers.“Employers end damaging business’s morale, productivity culture risking litigation proceedings anyway,” says Horne.
“For employees, there’s mental-health impact feeling excluded, frustrated angry.
They lose confidence becomes self-fulfilling prophecy: performance declines even further.” Fixing requires better-resourced managers, greater HR support acceptance workplace confrontation sometimes best.
However, time cost needed educate managers better motivate employees deal difficult situations means that, realistically, quiet firing may stay.
“Training expensive,” says Kayes.
“It takes huge investment requires leaders open it; acceptance need ask hard questions.Human psychology plays part, too.
Ultimately, quiet firing avoidance difficult emotions.
“There implication manager nasty manipulative quietly fire employee, person either side table,” says Horne.

Yet also happens way around, even discourse less frequent.
This may part data indicates parents severing ties children rarer: 2015 study conducted British estrangement charity Stand Alone showed 5% estranged parents initiated themselves.The decision already difficult painful, experience estrangement say relative rarity makes especially isolating, add stigma choose pursue path.‘Unconditional love problematic’“In research popular culture, rarely hear parents estrange children it’s taboo, non-judgemental places speak openly experience,” explains Lucy Blake, senior lecturer psychology University West England, Bristol, specialises estrangement.The reasons parents end relationships children similar reasons kids cut parents: according Blake, among common cited family conflict, differences personal values (such religious beliefs), substance abuse toxic behaviour.
The Stand Alone research showed relationship breakdowns sons, issues linked divorce, in-laws marriage widely reported drivers; daughters, mental-health problems emotional abuse common.Yet decision fracture children tends far trying ultimately difficult.
Societally, parents expected cherish care offspring without exception.
“We high, almost godlike expectations parent, want unconditionally loving,” explains Blake.
“This quite problematic, suggests accept kind treatment, including kinds psychological financial abuse.”This perhaps why, even children hurting them, parents struggle let go.
Jennifer Storey, psychology lecturer University Kent, UK, specialises interpersonal violence, finds interviews victims elder abuse, parents still worried sad children.
“I struggling remember one parent really wanted cut child – almost always wanted relationship continue, abuse end,” explains.It also hard people around accept reality what’s happening.
“Parents assumed power, child grows older, power dynamic shifts,” says Amanda Holt, author book Adolescent-to-Parent Abuse: Current Understandings Research, Policy Practice.
“The lack belief child-parent abuse happen, bad parent needs leave, another reason it’s difficult walk away.”The “intergenerational stake hypothesis” may also work.
This theory suggests parents typically invested – emotionally, financially physically – parent-child relationship children.
Greater positive ties children associated parent’s improved wellbeing, greater quality life lower depressive symptoms; greater positive ties parent guarantee benefits.
This means parent’s choice sever contact child, whether abruptly gradually, doesn’t come weight failure.“Parenthood role identity that’s respected admired – it’s also life-changing lifelong,” explains Blake.

worklife,"In TV series The Good Place, character Chidi Anagonye defined inability make even simplest decisions – choosing eat, proclaiming love soulmate.
The idea making choice often results serious stomach-ache.
He stuck continued ‘analysis paralysis’.
We meet Chidi afterlife, learn indecisiveness cause death.
While standing street, endlessly equivocating bar visit best friend, air-conditioning unit apartment falls head, killing instantly.
“You know sound fork makes garbage disposal?
That's sound brain makes time,” says one episode.
And besides making unhappy, Chidi’s lack confidence judgements drives people around crazy.
If sounds like exaggerated version you, alone: indecisiveness common trait.
While people come quick judgements, others struggle weigh options – may even try avoid making choice all.
As Chidi shows, indecisiveness linked problems like anxiety, yet recent research suggests also upside – protects us common cognitive errors like confirmation bias, person finally come judgement, generally wiser jumped conclusion quickly.
The trick learn wait, break inertia it’s holding back.
The enemy good Psychologists various tools measure indecisiveness.
One common questionnaires – Frost Indecisiveness Scale – asks participants rate series statements scale 1 (strongly disagree) 5 (strongly agree).
They include: Using scale, psychologists shown indecisiveness often product perfectionism.
Perfectionists scared shame regret may come making wrong choice – put making decisions feel certain right thing.
(And cases, course, simply never reach level confidence.)
The frustration brings barrier happiness; general, higher someone scores scale above, lower score measures life satisfaction, according study Eric Rassin, professor psychology Erasmus University, Netherlands.
They less likely endorse statements “the conditions life excellent”, example, “if I could live life over, I would change almost nothing”.Indecision often perceived negative trait - may surprising advantages taking time (Credit: Getty)Jumping conclusions From results, indecisiveness would seem like wholly undesirable trait.
Recent research, however, suggests struggle come quick conclusion – uncomfortable may – also upside, since protects people important cognitive biases.
Evidence benefits comes recent paper Jana-Maria Hohnsbehn, doctoral researcher, Iris Schneider, professor social psychology, TU Dresden (Technische Universität Dresden).
Rather using Frost Indecisiveness Scale, Hohnsbehn Schneider focused measure “trait ambivalence”, looks specifically thoughts feelings underlying someone’s judgement decision-making (or lack thereof).
For example, people asked rate statements as: “If statements resonate us, probably high trait ambivalence,” says Hohnsbehn.
As might expect, high trait ambivalence take longer time make decisions.
But Hohnsbehn Schneider found also less prone bias coming judgements.
For example, one experiment, asked participants read series scenarios, as: You meet person, would like find whether he/she introvert extrovert.
You guess person extrovert.
Which following two questions would ask?
Many people pick second question, sign confirmation bias – looking information agrees assumption, rather looking evidence may wrong.
Hohnsbehn colleagues found people high trait ambivalence less likely this.
Instead, chose interrogate assumption, order make sure information needed come correct answer.
For another experiment, participants read employee, Mr Müller, seeking get contract renewed.
After making preliminary decision whether allow Mr Müller continue role, participants given additional statements, ostensibly industry experts Mr Müller.
Some statements agreed participants’ initial decisions, others disagreed.
The participants’ task rate credibility importance one.
Hohnsbehn Schneider found people scoring high ambivalence tended open-minded statements disagreed initial point view, rated highly credibility importance – whereas showed little trait ambivalence likely discount them.
These findings important, since confirmation bias one common cognitive errors, preventing us analysing evidence rationally everything personal relationships political views.
Trait ambivalence helps protect us kind oversimplistic thinking – may also help us forms, too.
Studies Schneider, instance, suggest people high trait ambivalence also less prone “correspondence bias”, tendency ignore context someone’s behaviour instead attribute failures successes directly person themselves.
To give straightforward example: someone slips over, correspondence bias might lead us conclude inherently clumsy (an internal factor), rather recognising slipperiness floor (an external factor).
Correspondence bias might also lead us assume someone struggling education simply lacks intelligence, rather considering strains financial difficulties responsibilities within family.
People high trait ambivalence likely recognise factors people form quick confident judgements.Indecision problem becomes excessive, experts say (Credit: Getty)Action inaction Hohnsbehn’s research good news you’ve ever felt impatient inability come quick decision.
“The general experience ambivalent needs embraced,” suggests.
“It give us necessary pause, signalling us things complex need time engage careful thought decision.” It becomes excessive face problems.
“As things, balance needs struck,” adds Hohnsbehn.
That might explain indecisive people often score lower measures life satisfaction – ambivalence, facing important choices, become overwhelming.
One simple step might set time limit final decision spend much time ruminating different options without actually gaining new insights.
Depending type problem facing, Hohnsbehn suggests might even consider turning series tasks – devoting two hours search new information, example, spending certain amount time deliberating.
If still feel paralysed, might find inspiration study Steven Levitt, economist University Chicago, examined people’s overall happiness making important life changes.
Levitt, co-author book Freakonomics, set website people described various dilemmas facing lives – getting tattoo moving house, returning education quitting jobs.
The participants asked flip coin, outcome would tell whether make change.
Following participants following months, Levitt found many people taken plunge; coin toss told take action, likely make life change.
And reported significantly happier simply carried (regardless whether coin told not), without quitting, moving getting tattoo.
We guess that, study, participants already thinking carefully situation hand, worries making wrong choice prevented taking plunge.
The coin simply acted small nudge finally overcome ambivalence.
The moral study, then, make decisions whim tossed coin.
It breaking hesitancy doubt leave happier might imagine.
“A good rule thumb decision making is, whenever cannot decide do, choose action represents change, rather continuing status quo,” concluded Levitt.
Like Chidi The Good Place, weigh pros cons every situation – ambivalence help us make wiser choices.
Once ambivalent thinking served purpose, however, must learn cast aside – safe knowledge decision often better making choice all.David Robson science writer author The Expectation Effect: How Your Mindset Can Transform Your Life, published Canongate (UK) Henry Holt (USA) early 2022.

It’s industry historically pays well: even pandemic, biggest firms offered undergraduates salaries often approached six-figure mark.
However, current market, Nguyen’s clients particularly well.
“They’ll come back say ‘I two great offers’,” explains founder My Consulting Offer, based Georgia, US.
“One $120,000 (£91,630), $140,000 (£106,900).
Today’s climate means graduates earn much money years ago.”Management consulting among sectors graduates increasingly walking straight lecture hall six-figure roles – earning pay packets people never see lifetimes.
In Big Tech, entry-level software engineers often starting wages.
At largest banking corporations, pay first-year analysts spiked nearly 30% – $110,000 (£83,979) base salary, cases.
At biggest London law firms, newly qualified solicitors begin careers £107,500 salary ($141,115).
Nguyen says “20-year-olds earning $100,000 get-go” increasingly become norm since pandemic.Often, young employees joining firms colleagues began lower pay, work hard years earn six figures.
Such organisations would argue it’s response market needs: hiring crisis means competition talent remains fierce; employer wants best candidates willing put long hours, pay high price them.However, beyond matching market rate, offering graduates huge pay packets actually bring benefits, like incentivising longer hours boosting work ethic?
Or create unintended consequences, young high-earner well wider workforce?‘High pay expectation’ Wages graduates steadily rising years.
According 2021 data US non-profit National Association Colleges Employers, starting salary entry-level workers particular fields spiked dramatically: example, average wage computer-science major risen $72,173 (£55,100) – 7% hike one year.Nicholas Bloom, professor economics Stanford University, says demand labour fast outstripping supply sectors, particularly tech.
The financial industry – jobs often require 70-hour-plus workweeks – also driven starting salaries hire best candidates.
So, cases, graduates handed six-figure salaries simply “blunt recruitment tool” amid current labour market conditions, adds Rue Dooley, HR knowledge advisor Society Human Resource Management (SHRM), based US.“Workers want thought prized asset employer,” says Dooley.
“Younger employees saying high pay expectation necessarily demand it, they’re aware talent shortage know price.” This means entry-level workers secure huge pay packets they’ve even left college dorm.
“We’re regularly seeing firms double size every 18 months, graduate salaries closely following market,” adds Bloom.In tech, smaller start-ups also pay entry-level employees higher salaries match more-established corporations.
Josh Brenner, CEO recruitment marketplace Hired, based New York City, says US employers paying first-year tech workers average starting salary $110,027 (£84,000).
Nguyen’s undergrad clients often land jobs wages dwarf pay first management consulting role.
He believes good thing.
“The six-figure starting salaries today upward trend stretches back decades,” says.
“High pay opens opportunities people simply wouldn’t otherwise them, doesn’t take money away started lower pay.”In sectors including law, consulting, finance computer science, graduates snagging pay packets many people never earn lives (Credit: Getty Images)Golden handcuffs – problemsBut many upsides rise six-figure salaries, high compensation packets come insidious consequences.In cases, workers may find trapped jobs hate, especially workers built lifestyles around earning big pay-outs – phenomenon often called ‘golden handcuffs’.Nguyen says wages also skew young employees’ perception pay, blocking pursuing meaningful career paths.
“Some may want eventually move teaching work non-profit.
Previously, salary drop around $50,000.
Now, it’s closer $100,000 – could enough prevent someone changing careers.”Huge salaries also weigh young employees psychological burden.
Nguyen says undergraduate clients feel intimidated beginning working lives job pays fortune.
“There come low-income backgrounds think, ‘What I earn much parents ever made?’ It cause imposter syndrome.” Others organisations also feel negative effects first-time employees handed six-figure salaries without hesitation.
For example, experienced colleagues may bristle entry-level compensation packets – especially take home less money recent graduate, despite years-long tenure company.
“It create pay disparity issues,” says Dooley.Additionally, companies may necessarily get pay for.
While sky-high wages effectively ‘buy’ candidate’s willingness regularly clock unpaid overtime, doesn’t necessarily guarantee better work ethic.“The risk employers, cases, assume staff going super motivated high compensation, fact take granted,” says Tomas Chamorro, professor business psychology University College London.
“High wages may feel good someone gets job, start, typically want much more: effects good pay psychologically ‘spent’.” 'Jobs grab can'With labour market is, six-figure starting salaries probably continue norm certain high-paying industries.
But it’s unlikely there’ll much trickle-down effect entry-level workers less elite sectors.Rather push wages across board, six-figure salaries ultra-privileged subset employees may instead drive pay inequities deeper.
“What we’re seeing clearly increasing inequality gap keeps growing,” says Bloom.
“If computer-science degree earning $250,000 25, left school 16 might earning $25,000 – ten-fold difference.”The gap likely keep growing even labour market snaps back terms supply demand.
Bloom explains wages often rise, almost never fall.
For example, Nguyen says salaries management consulting long endured rigours recession.
“We’ve seen wages withstand many economic cycles: firms plan restructure pay, wouldn’t ever get rid six-figure salary.”So, given resistance ebb flow market, six-figure graduate wages likely become ingrained, may also climb further.
And jobs become scarcer due labour-market normalisation, pay packets become increasingly reach people.
“Six-figure starting salaries stay, growth cools it'll mean they’ll even harder come by,” says Bloom.
“These jobs grab – – privileged few.”

“I wanted able date men women simultaneously whole life,” says Chris, withholding surname privacy.
“I felt like monogamy would deny something myself.”During pandemic, Chris moved intentional, sex-positive community Brooklyn, New York – “safe space” could explore relationship sex sexuality.
Through community, discovered course called Open Smarter, guided students navigating various types ethically non-monogamous relationships.
That’s first heard term ‘solo polyamory’.
He quickly felt like fit dating style.At core, solo polyamory refers people open dating engaging multiple meaningful relationships without ‘primary partner’: one person they’re committed partners.
Instead, solo polyamorist might see primary partner, eschewing typical relationship goals, like merging finances homes partner, getting married children.
Solo polyamorists represent small portion polyamorists general, many tend aim primary partner, says Philadelphia-based sex educator therapist Liz Powell, 39, it’s inherently difficult figure percentage overall population engaging relationships way.
However, studies show younger generations likely entered kind non-monogamous relationship older generations.
Per 2020 YouGov survey 1,300 US adults, 43% millennials said ideal relationship would non-monogamous, 30% Gen X said same.
Overall, research 2016 synthesising two different US studies showed 20% respondents engaged consensually non-monogamous relationship point.
But studies don’t break numbers specific types non-monogamous relationships, it’s impossible say many surveyed identify solo polyamory.Since solo polyamorists minority identity, misconceptions lifestyles abound.
From people equate solo polyamory monogamists dating around find “the one”, consider selfish greedy move, like “having cake eating it, too”, there’s tendency overlook term’s nuanced definition.
Ultimately, boils stepping what’s known heteronormative “relationship escalator”, opting alternative way engage romantic sexual partnerships.For many solo polyamorists, identity enables explore different sexual desires experiences without adhering heteronormative expectations (Credit: Getty Images)The “relationship escalator”The term solo polyamory gained popularity blog Solopoly.net, written journalist Amy Gahran, pen name Aggie Sez.
Her first blog post, published 2012, titled, “Riding relationship escalator (or not)”.
About five years later, wrote book subject, Stepping Off Relationship Escalator: Uncommon Love Life.Gahran defines ‘escalator’ “the default set societal customs proper conduct intimate relationships” – words, relationships hit, aim hit, traditional life markers, like moving partner, merging finances, getting engaged, getting married children.“We normalised benchmarks signs relationship serious,” says California-based Rachel Krantz, 34, author Open: An Uncensored Memoir Love, Liberation, Non-Monogamy – A Polyamory Memoir.
“Solo polyamorous people tend avoid intertwining life way someone else.” Though definition may seem narrow, plenty ways ‘solo poly’.
Solo polyamorous folks tend allosexual, says Colorado-based Elisabeth Sheff, author books including The Polyamorists Next Door, meaning tend experience sexual desire – asexual maintain multiple, non-sexual relationships.
They also tend “value independence”, adds Sheff, important, non-romantic relationships lives put first.
“The single parent prioritises children relationships could solo poly,” says Sheff, could someone who’s caretaker person disability.Solo polyamory also doesn’t forever.
One could identify solo poly today, still wind entering traditional relationship shared home finances future – doesn’t fixed identity valid, says New York-based sex researcher consultant Zhana Vrangalova.Chris, fact, expresses interest one day finding primary partner, says meantime solo poly “allows date, experiences people, get know lot different people, needs met”.
It’s similar dating around monogamously, adds, “except I’ve put label communicate people intentions are”.Vrangalova, who’s originally Macedonia, teaches Open Smarter course Chris attended New York.
She estimates two-thirds class people relationships, slightly half monogamous relationships “trying figure version non-monogamy would right them”.
The rest either already exploring various forms non-monogamy seeking skills help better navigate relationships, they’re single looking relationships.
Solo polyamory right everyone.
Vrangalova students take personality quizzes help determine relationship style(s) might work best them.
These quizzes ask questions like “how much adventure novelty” respondents need, much security require relationships.
Solo polyamorists, says Vrangalova, “usually need lot relational security”.However, someone identifies solo poly may need level security someone long-term, monogamous partnership, doesn’t mean can’t won’t form deep, lasting bonds partners.
To foster trusting relationships partners, sex-educator Powell, identifies solo poly, says they’re upfront potential partners wants needs.
“I'm going ask [what I want relationship] I’m worried going say no,” say.
“If people say no, say no, figure go there.”The antidote “couple privilege”?A lot stigmas surrounding solo polyamory come general lack understanding someone might want so-called “serious”, traditional relationship.
Stereotypes solo poly people include “selfish, avoidant [messed] various ways”, says Vrangalova.
Furthermore, solo polyamory marked lack adherence relationship benchmarks like marriage children – also serve benchmarks adulthood.
“The people consider ‘adults’ married kids, sharing houses, sharing finances,” says Powell.
“Whereas ‘wayward adults’, like myself, live alone, unmarried, examples everything wrong society.”Of course, adults successfully live self-sufficient.
For identify solo poly, also doesn’t mean “don’t care people”, says Sheff.
“They want organise life centrally around romantic partner.”Even though someone identifies solo poly, still form meaningful one-to-one relationships partners (Credit: Getty Images)These prejudices exist alongside another societal force known “couple privilege”.
This wide-reaching phrase refers advantages couples society singles (like financial benefits marriage couplehood) attitude that, instance, polyamorous relationship, success primary couple must prioritised.
All partners’ actions must taken preserving primary relationship mind.These stigmas societal expectations present roadblocks people identify solo poly.
When Powell polyamorous relationship Savannah, Georgia, US, around 2014, tried find non-monogamy-affirming therapist, avail.
That prompted fill void, Powell opened private practice targeting people identified non-monogamous, queer, kinky and/or trans.Even psychology circles, remains dearth knowledge polyamory, let alone solo polyamory.
Sheff part Division 44, subgroup American Psychological Association working develop educational materials polyamory counsellors therapists.More dating aroundUltimately, solo polyamory much way date multiple partners living alone.
It’s rejection heteronormative relationship standards.“For me, lot solo polyamory finding ways I centre autonomy, autonomy others genuinely question things I want relationship, rather assuming every relationship going follow escalator,” says Powell.Chris similarly attracted solo poly label let think approach relationships differently.
He says relationship pathways grew didn’t make sense him; gay marriage legalised US, sexual relationships people knew he’d never able wed. Today, Chris says wouldn’t 100% rule prospect marriage, he’s exactly fan institution.
“As queer, bisexual person, I like heteronormative structure marriage,” says.

“At point, pretty much one two podcasts actually broaching subject,” says dating coach.
“And people producing hosting podcasts used pseudonyms.” But things changed.
Around 2016, Winston noticed real “explosion interest around non-monogamy”, year started work dating coach specialising types relationships.
“That I feel like I saw biggest turning point, sudden many people online willing talk non-monogamous,” says, “and express fact interest sorts things.”Sarah Levinson, counsellor Creative Relating Psychology Psychotherapy New York City, specialises sexuality relationship dynamics, also noticed increasing interest open relationships within past decade.
“It much obscure 10 years ago, incredibly common,” says.
These accounts well data show growing interest consensually non-monogamous relationships, including open relationships.
Experts say many societal cultural factors led wider embrace non-traditional relationship styles, pandemic may even playing part.
But interest open relationships may climbing, experts mixed wide uptake may actually – least right now.
'Free passes' swingingThere many ways engage non-monogamy, says Levinson.
“It could anything living multiple partners sharing finances, could supporting partner year free pass work conference state hook-up.”Open relationships fall non-monogamy umbrella, many tend differentiate types arrangements types non-monogamy, like polyamory.
Polyamory often means participating multiple intimate partnerships, open relationships often associated people engaging primarily sexual relationships outside prioritised, two-person partnership.
In words, open relationships less focused emotional connections people outside primary relationship, sexual ones.Open relationships generally associated people engaging primarily sexual relationships outside prioritised, two-person partnership (Credit: Getty Images)For some, means going casual dates ‘friends-with-benefits’-type relationships people primary partners.
For others, open relationship means occasional “free pass” one-night stand brief sexual fling.
And others still, arrangement could look like swinging – sex couples couple, going dates separately.
Winston also brings “don’t ask, don’t tell”-style open relationships, members couple permit sexual relations people – don’t want discuss experiences together.Other terms, like “monogamish”, US-based relationship sex columnist Dan Savage popularised several years ago, overlap definitionally open-relationship arrangements.
Savage discussed monogamish relationship podcast, partner committed other, still non-committal sex men.
People stripes engaging open relationships.
Over past years, Levinson says she’s seeing “quite bit diversity” among participating open relationships sessions, terms everything “economic resources” “ethnicity”.
(However, acknowledges counsellor working New York City, gets see different sample one might come across conservative parts US.)
Among Winston’s client base, podcast listeners website visitors, she’s found many interested participating open relationships tend skew relatively young – ages 25 45.
And many identify queer, bisexual and/or pansexual.
However, practice, she’s worked clients interested practicing open relationships young 19 old 70s.
“The people come door completely span spectrum,” says.‘Getting curious’ Dating-app trends help highlight rise interest open relationships.
For one, emergence platforms particularly focused non-monogamy, including open relationships, cater rising curiosity.
But even traditional dating apps, OkCupid, seen spike interest open relationships.
“While majority OkCupid daters seek monogamous relationships, 2021, users seeking non-monogamous relationships increased 7%,” OkCupid representative told BBC Worklife.
Among 1 million UK-based OkCupid users responded question, ‘Would consider open relationship?’ app, 31% percent said yes 2022, compared 29% 2021 26% 2020.Additionally, 2022 data dating app Hinge showed one five Hinge users “would consider” trying open relationship, one 10 already engaged one.
Hinge’s director relationship science Logan Ury says may pandemic effect, since believes “the perfect opportunity pause think want.”Counsellors professionals including Levinson Winston also observed uptick.
Winston says much recent interest she’s seen open relationships comes millennials simply “questioning way they’ve raised” – cases, believe long-term, married monogamy end goal intimate relationships.This may stem overall trend towards open mindedness, believes Levinson.
“Societally, open minded sorts identities less conventional… people willing challenge societal constructs general way.” This opened door people question desires, too.
When “you keep choosing monogamy working… start getting curious [whether] there’s another way”.And curious, resources ever.
Along “explosion interest” open relationships, adds Winston, there’s “explosion content creators people writing media… apps, community meetups”.
This means information non-monogamy widely accessible – “old, dusty LiveJournals [personal online journals] corners internet”, Winston says needed look information decade ago.
More fantasy reality?Despite people embracing non-monogamous arrangements, rising visibility around open relationships, general perception still leans negative.
“Research public opinion polls suggest attitudes toward consensual non-monogamy mostly negative overall, although appear trended positive recent years,” says Dr Justin Lehmiller, Kinsey Institute research fellow host Sex Psychology Podcast.
While negative attitudes may stop people thinking open relationships, deter engaging them.
In research sexual fantasies, instance, Lehmiller found “most people fantasised non-monogamous way before, participating swinging, opening relationship polyamorous”.
However, adds, “relatively practising real life”.
Although post-pandemic data many people arrangements, Canadian research 2019 puts figure 4%, similar figure emerging 2018 US study.Even increasing number people engaging open relationships, subject may remain taboo, say experts (Credit: Getty Images)Levinson believes may part stem entrenched perception open relationships broadly seen ‘unhealthy’.
Among therapist colleagues, Levinson observed plenty still view “dyad” “couple bubble” “only workable way secure attachment”, says.
She feels attitudes “cut people feeling like viable option them”.
Religious beliefs also deter people engaging sexual and/or dating relationships one person time, cultural norms certain communities.
Even so, Winston sees people, particularly millennials Gen Z, continuing move away idea one partner fulfil needs (something traditionally monogamous concept marriage encourages).
She points platonic friends deciding live together coparent well declining marriage rates, suggest possible future societal shift way people engage relationships.
“People branching creating relationships make sense lives,” says.
While Levinson agrees continued increase “creative relationship structures” similar reasons, doesn’t think become global phenomenon.
Too many cultures around world present challenges people hoping open relationships, taboo remains globally prevalent.
OkCupid’s head global communications Michael Kaye different view.
“The behaviours see among daters today around forever.
But people becoming open transparent identify [and] want relationship.
I think every single passing year, becoming little bit less judgmental others.”

Rather, people arrangements willingly opt grey area undefined relationship.
According Armstrong, believe “the situationship, whatever reason, works right now.

For instance, pandemic entirely changed way many people meet partners date, large-scale move towards online dating often takes toll.Additionally, many young people simply aren’t putting emphasis dating intentionally past; facing climate crisis, unstable economy surging inflation political social upheaval, young people involved advocacy search personal, professional financial stability first.
“Young people would say relationships distracting educational career goals, best get attached, might sacrifice trajectory life someone else,” says Wade.As result, situationships best option Gen Zers looking explore romantic sexual identities without letting commitments take backseat.
The phenomenon “diversifies sense options people have”, says Armstrong, it’s become increasingly normal opt grey area instead avoiding it.But, course, murky-by-definition arrangement doesn’t come without precarity – even risk.

In short, says Gostick, it’s made people lot less likely things don’t want do.
“I think pandemic made us little angrier, little cynical overall, people aren’t putting things consider annoying much anymore,” says.
Thus, many disillusioned virtual team-building activities organised managers desperate keep people engaged.
But doesn’t mean colleagues stopped connecting altogether, says Lopushinsky.
They started ways actually found enjoyable.
“On flip side, pandemic also led rise employee-led initiatives,” says.
Team-building events ‘fun’ ceased top-down.
“Employees would lead Zoom yoga class, cooking class colleagues.
It’s interesting shift, away ‘you this,’ toward, ‘what guys really want do?’”Gostick saw similar trend emerge among clients pandemic wore on.
One, major American corporation, started holding weekly “wine-and-whine” parties Zoom.
“It’s like four o’clock Friday.
If want drink could, not, whatever.
But come whine week,” says Gostick.
“It’s hour, everybody complains talks terrible clients aggravating bosses.”Rather creating toxic negative environment, adds Gostick, wine-and-whine events allow workers blow steam, let go frustrations week, prepare enjoy weekend ultimately feel refreshed Monday morning.
It’s authentic kind fun employees continued embrace return office.
“Companies know need looking ways bring people together feels authentic,” says.
“It’s planning party.
It’s making meaningful, making people actually want there.” Giving workers good reason go backToday, two years remote work, large number people longer want return physical office.
In US, according February 2022 Pew Research study, close 60% who’ve working home would prefer continue so.
In UK, statistic even stark.
Employees ordered back, says Gostick, likely simply quit.
So, says, companies need ways “lure people back”.And certainly trying.
Companies offering everything food trucks free T-shirts to, case Google, private performance Lizzo.
But celebrations might draw crowd, enthusiasm wanes it’s time go back desks.“One clients built big new office pandemic, finally opened months ago big party,” says Gostick.
“They like 90% people show up.
Everybody great time, excited see other.
But Monday, maybe 10% people came in.
People desperate see other, still prefer work remotely.”Mandatory socialisation breed fake smiles – even stoke discord among workers feel option participate (Credit: Getty Images)The flashy parties may work first, companies need longer-term fun strategy, says Gostick; ways create fun meaningful enough people want participate compelling enough keep coming back.
“It’s shift from, ‘Everyone gather around, it’s Stan’s birthday cupcakes’, getting together meaningful way,” says Gostick.
That means continuing events – like wine-and-whine Friday – popular useful pandemic, planning others don’t require people stay working hours, invest time energy might like spend somewhere else.
It also means understanding people simply won’t come, holding them.
The half equation, course, can’t forced.
“It’s got guilt, obligation,” says Gostick.
“You give people option opt out.”That’s benefit management, too, adds Lopushinsky.
If ultimate goal office fun facilitate team bonding, it’ll work lot better nobody feels obliged attend.
“That kind get-together positive impact anyway.
It’s team bonding would happen naturally, opposed forcing it.” Post-pandemic, people craving good time other’s company ever, says Gostick, “and yet inane office ‘fun’ yesteryear wholly passed.
We realise, maybe before, every minute time precious.
If bosses want it, they’ve got use wisely.”

worklife,"Throughout past years, workers resigning jobs record numbers.
Some switching careers, job-hopping faster advancement left workforce altogether.
In US, instance, August 2022 data Bureau Labor Statistics puts labour force participation rate 1.0 percentage point February 2020 level.In words, people quitting and, sectors jobs, haven’t coming back.
Perhaps it’s unsurprising, given poor conditions many workplaces throughout pandemic.
The dearth workers evident hospitality service-work industries, positions dishwashers, truck drivers, retail workers, food servers, airport agents, home health aides similar roles open literal years.
This people don’t want work, say experts.
They want better jobs; higher pay, improved conditions.
The job market upheaval caused pandemic enabled workers switch better employment – hard-hit sectors want workers back, need find ways making jobs attractive.
Why jobs open?Particularly US, data shows it’s tough service worker long time.
In 2020, instance, full-time American food counter workers made, average, $23,960 (£20,796) year – failing clear poverty line four-person household.
Weekly hours rarely guaranteed, making difficult workers sure income would cover bills, arrange things like transport childcare.All that, part, accounts fact attrition rate – words, rate people leave percentage annual average employment – high service industries long time.
In 2017, 53.8% retail workers, 72.4% workers accommodation food service 30.6% people manufacturing jobs.Food-service roles open literal years, employers scrambling fill positions (Credit: Getty Images)But service worker hard pre-pandemic, struck things became downright miserable many.
Retailers stayed open faced supply-chain disruption, spikes drops customer demand.
Fewer employees work hours, increased overtime contributed burnout.
With schools closed public transport reduced, workers negotiating lack childcare difficult commute.
Cases worker abuse reports rude customers shot up, though companies offered one-time bonuses, increased wages offered hazard pay.And many instances, work hazardous.
Other forms business moved online, “in hospitality industry, instance, hard replace somebody who's reception desk hotel somebody who's working virtually”, says Serge da Motta Veiga, professor human resource management EDHEC Business School Paris.
That meant frontline service workers, forced interact colleagues customers everyone else sheltering home, among vulnerable Covid-19.
In first year pandemic, 68% working-age adults died US labour, retail service workers.
Understandably, throughout last two years, attrition rates shot up.
In 2021, 64.6% retail workers, whopping 86.3% accommodation food service workers, 40% manufacturing workers quit jobs.
While safety – overall misery – leading factors, weren’t reasons mass exodus.
People also crave stability, difficult come low-wage job: one 2019 study found minimum wage jobs turnover rate twice US national average.
“Those jobs precarious,” says da Motta Veiga.
“Job security become number one thing people want, even perks, like flexible work schedule, working wherever want.”There’s yet another reason many people quit: could.
The staffing shortage left many companies mercy work – don’t – them.
With labour market leaning far favour worker, it’s easier workers leave one job get another, lessening incentive people return jobs find undesirable.
The people used jobs replaced gig work, moved new industries, says da Motta Veiga.
“They're trying transfer skills industries actually respected, well-paid opportunity,” says.Why aren’t people coming back fill jobs?The epidemic quitting throughout 2021 year, known Great Resignation, left job openings across industries.
But David Dwertmann, associate professor management Rutgers University School Business, Camden, US, says it’s difficult re-hire workers fill low-wage jobs particular, reasons people left first place.He points Pew Research Survey asked people quit jobs reason leaving.
Low pay first, followed “no opportunities advancement” “feeling disrespected”.“If flipping burgers something, easy advance.
Not everyone going manager.
Many people stuck jobs years years years,” says Dwertmann.
Plus, “the workers feel like they're valued enough, feel like they're treated well enough”.
With market awash better opportunities, people feeling stagnant mistreated jobs seized golden opportunity bail.Another factor, adds Dwertmann, wave Baby Boomer retirements left still gaps workforce.
“It's kind perfect storm,” says.
“I think Covid-19 probably [Boomers considering retirement] great reason say, ‘You know what?
I'm done.’ Because groups highest risk Covid exposure, especially working face-to-face service jobs.
I think could afford so, large cohort particular population chose retire.
I would assume many probably never come back labour force.” This Boomer exodus, notes Dwertmann, compounded lack immigration past several years left gaps industries normally employ new arrivals.
“In part due pandemic, part due changes policy, immigration United States actually dropped half,” says.
“And people used fulfil take low-skill, low-education jobs.”Airport workers among quit returned positions (Credit: Getty Images)What companies try fill ‘unfillable’?It’s unusual, days, see signs outside fast-food restaurants, convenience stores markets offering previously unheard-of starting hourly wages new hires.
Many employers instituted sign-on bonuses: 2021, Amazon announced hiring push said would pay $1,000 bonuses warehouse transport jobs.
Hilton Hotels began offering sign-on bonuses $500 room attendants staff.Yet financial incentives don’t hurt, don’t anything address major things workers want “unfillable” jobs don’t often offer; flexibility, predictability better conditions.
“I think employers need react increasing wages providing sign-on bonuses, also, example, scheduling employees different ways,” says Dwertmann.
“Making sure there's predictability employees terms come in, many hours get work, can, example, manage childcare.”Focusing money alone, agrees da Motta Veiga, short-sighted.
While, yes, people want paid feel time energy worth, companies also “be asking people: ‘What want?
What priority?
Is security?
Is flexibility?’” They need creative, says, making jobs attractive.To fill unfillable job, concludes Dwertmann, make financially worthwhile, also provide flexibility, guarantee safety find way generate loyalty.“The pandemic comes around first thing people lay big troves workers,” says.
“They thinking eased everyone would show again, really employees like, ‘You know what?
You didn’t stick me.
I’m going back you.’”Correction 21 Sept 2022: An earlier version article provide sufficient context around statistic percentage service workers died pandemic.

worklife,"As 2022 comes close, we're bringing back favourite pieces year.
See rest Best Worklife 2022 collection great reads.When Laura invited final-stage interview multinational music corporation based London, thought cusp landing dream role.
After passing first-round phone interview meeting team members person, Laura meet senior-level executive.
“It presented formality,” says.
“The interview went well, I later told I’d got job.”And – nothing.
Despite receiving initial guarantees would joining team, email formally confirming Laura's role never arrived.
She’d send occasional follow-ups firm’s HR department receive non-committal replies.
“It always instigating conversation,” says Laura.
“The last message I received said promised contact soon information new role.
I never heard again.”Laura ghosted.
Rather sending formal rejection explanation happened, potential employer ignored her.
It’s practice that’s common recruitment process; one recent study 1,500 global workers found 75% jobseekers ghosted company job interview.
Employers openly acknowledge it; 27% US employers surveyed job listings site Indeed said hadn’t ghosted candidate past year.But it’s companies.
Right now, employees ghosting back – potentially higher numbers ever before.
In 2021 Indeed survey, 28% workers said they’d ghosted employer – compared 19% two years before.
The phenomenon seems happening stages recruitment process.
While employers reported candidates cut communications following initial phone screening, quarter said new hires “no-showed” first day work.Ghosting considered bad practice companies workers; one likes receiving end it.
Yet rise seems inexorable: digital hiring processes deluge companies candidates, making replying everyone hard, even labour shortages give job-hunters options employers scramble talent.
Is inevitable consequence increasingly discourteous recruitment process – steps taken sides avert downward spiral?Easier – impersonal?‘Ghosting’ originally coined dating world: meant sudden, unexpected end contact.
It’s social phenomenon increasingly co-opted workplace – put practice either side interview table.Being able suddenly drop communications recruitment process generally favours party powerful position.
Traditionally, employers likely ghost workforce.
However, even Covid-19, ghosting become growing trend among candidates, too: thanks tightening job market, could afford begin mimicking companies’ behaviour.But pandemic acted catalyst, fuelling current spike.
Yuletta Pringle, Society Human Resource Management, based Virginia, US, says rise coming workers employers.
Pringle attributes uptick fall-out Great Resignation.
“Labour shortages left employers pinched desperate hire, meaning push ton feelers online may able respond everyone,” explains.
“On employee side, many job vacancies – may ghosting potential employers search ideal role move around recruitment process.”In many cases, recruitment processes digitised.
Job-search algorithms place open positions right front workers.
‘Easy apply’ options mean candidates send resumes multiple jobs effortlessly ever.
Virtual interviews improved accessibility, increasing opportunities employers workers find best fit.
“Before pandemic, fraction interviews brokered us would done virtually,” says Craig Freedberg, regional director recruitment firm Robert Half, based London.
“Now, 99% first-stage interviews via Zoom calls.”However, convenience digitised virtual recruitment comes cost.
Employers widen net interview people result hiring crisis.
That creates knock-on effect hiring managers who, whether inside firms external recruitment companies, dealing glut applicants roles.
“Much ghosting we’re seeing today may simply fact someone can’t get back everyone,” says Pringle.
The loss in-person interviews may also factor ghosting parties.
“It sometimes harder build rapport someone virtually,” says Freedberg.
“The emotional investment travelling meet someone in-person interview difficult replicate you’re clicking calendar link home, it’s easier employers ghost you’re losing human, face-to-face element.”The process can, therefore, feel increasingly transactional.
And, current buoyant job market, applicants may well swamped, too.
“Candidates approached time abundance jobs choose from,” says Freedberg.
“If multiple applications go, easier simply ignore one them.”From recruiters' end, explosion candidates due new digital recruiting may mean applicants find waiting emails never come (Credit: Getty Images)Balancing ghosting professionalism Market conditions may well mean replying every lead candidate becoming normalised.
But ghosting comes downsides employers candidates: leaves bad impression – likely ending professional relationship it’s even begun.For reason, companies, particularly relationship-led ones, remain staunchly anti-ghosting – even they’ve receiving end themselves.
“In industry, it’s important approachable build strong relationships, we’re certainly anti-ghosting,” says Christoph Hardt, founder consultancy marketplace Comatch, based Berlin.
“Nevertheless, we’re seeing requests consultants go unanswered.
That seen unprofessional, it’s consequence current market: worker may ghost simply they’re busy.”Pringle suggests employers workers could benefit thinking constitutes ghosting strays unprofessionalism.
“If job posting and, digital process, push vacancy hundreds candidates reply one individually, ghosting?
Or, would ghosting made contact ways communication drops?
It would helpful define first.”Like dating namesake, Freedberg believes interview ghosting rooted lack commitment.
“A precursor ghosting either party doesn’t feel bought process emotional investment,” says.
“There greater emphasis approaching people genuinely think right job.
And, someone takes time day interview, virtually person, deserve feedback.”Pringle believes responsibility communication still falls employer’s side – says right kind communication limit prospect ghosting outset.
“If employer clear specific requirements position possible, right beginning hiring process, could help reduce ghosting employees’ side,” says.Keeping touch candidates recruitment process also important, stresses Freedberg.
“Much time, it’s managing expectations,” says.
“If delays recruitment process either side, responding people’s emails letting know always considered good practice.”But workers responsibilities, too.
Freedberg suggests rather applying jobs autopilot, workers mindfully select positions offer good cultural fit.
Otherwise, risk wasting recruiters’ time.
“If candidate agrees meet employer interview, decides ghost, that’s something client won’t happy with,” adds.
“It’s bad practice.”Generally speaking, sides, rule thumb seems go recruitment process, less acceptable ghost.
The effort applicant company invested recruitment process, ruder abrupt end contact feel.
Inevitably, leave bad impression – case Laura.In end, never received rejection email.
Instead, delays, doubt ghosting experienced inflicted deeper psychological blow – one caused rethink entire career.
“I’d rather told whatever reason I didn’t get job,” says.
“There excuses ghost me: I’d invested much time energy reaching point, drop face Earth.”
