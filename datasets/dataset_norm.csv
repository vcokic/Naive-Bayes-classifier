andré gide that great connect point for 20thcenturi french literatur agre prais chéri for it intellig masteri and understand of the leastadmit secret of the fleshth stori of colett and her work is one of the most astonish in modern literatur
she wa a pioneer of the french school of autofict autobiograph fiction write about women' live in way that broke new ground
her book were simultan popular and acclaim – read by critic and the public alik – not to mention scandal
and she made of her life a project just as fascin as her book

onc she wrote them – at time lock in a room to spur her to complet – and they were garnish with a few editori suggest by willi some girlish high jinks… you see what i mean
willi had them publish under hi own name and kept the copyright and royaltiescolette' first husband willi publish her first book under hi name keep the copyright and royalti credit alamyin report about colette' life the usual word to describ willi is deplor and so he wa but he did give colett a tast for parisian cultur life – she met marcel proust mauric ravel claud debussi and more – and did hi bit to boost the sale of hi book which were slow until he arrang for three of hi friend to write favour review

claudin becam what colette' biograph judith thurman call the century' first teenag with her spongelik absorpt of adult behaviour and in the book we see the develop of colette' masteri of sensuou descript as well as her first ransack of her own life for materi which can make read the wed night scene in claudin marri a somewhat voyeurist experi
it wa in these book too that we saw colette' first handl of love in fiction – although claudin in pari is probabl the last book where colett would write about love uncrit romant without the power dynam and ambigu that made her later work so piquant
men are terribl she onc wrote ad women too

it wa the vagabond that catapult colett to literari acclaim for the first time and the book won three vote for the prestigi prix goncourtwrit 'immoral' bookscolette' time in music hall might have galvanis her interest in put herself centrestag in her fiction

culture,"is calm a passiv state of be involv numb oneself to what' realli go on
is it in some case unnatur – sociopath even
or is a sens of tranquil one of the greatest qualiti we can have
here are five idea about calm from the philosophi of seren to the music art and poetri that can make us feel peac – and how to find our flowmor like thi eight natur book to chang your life the scifi genr offer hope insid japan' most minimalist homessto serenitystay calm and seren regardless of what life throw at you advis the roman philosoph marcu aureliu
sound easier said than done you would think
but in fact the stoic aureliu had a knack for make calm seem easi to achiev
the philosoph epictetu and other stoic believ that find calm wa essenti – and within our control credit alamyaurelius' famou work medit is accord to john sellar – author and reader at royal holloway univers of london – all about put our everyday care and concern into wider perspect
as emperor of rome aureliu face huge pressur but sellar tell bbc cultur he often remind himself how brief hi life is compar to the vast of time and how small it is compar to the whole of the cosmo
in line with hi stoic life view aureliu also remind himself constantli that whatev frustrat or neg emot he might be feel are ultim the product of hi own judgment or interpret about situat and so as a consequ thing within hi power to control say sellar
but whi the emphasi on be calm
is it realli that import to find peac
in the stoic mindset it seem calm is everyth – it is strength
as aureliu write in medit the nearer a man come to a calm mind the closer he is to strength
sellar explain calm is essenti to live a good happi life marcu and hi fellow stoic would insist
thi is becaus a disturb or troubl mind isn’t go to be abl to make sensibl ration decis
the person in the grip of violent emot for instanc liter isn't think straight
they have been overcom and may act impuls or violent
in order to make good decis we need a calm frame of mind so that we can paus and reflect rather than behav mere reactiv
accord to the stoic we just need to see that calm is within our control
whatev is go on in the world it all depend on our judgment and interpret of situat not the situat themselv explain sellar
the philosoph epictetu he add who wa aurelius' primari influenc wrote when we are frustrat angri or unhappi never hold anyon except ourselv – that is our judgement – account
thi core stoic idea wa say sellar a huge influenc on the founder of modern cognit behaviour therapi cbt and it effect ha been proven by the mani studi of cbt that have been made
the electron album stellar drift by georg fitzgerald is inspir by the cosmo – set sun is a particularli tranquil listen credit georg fitzgeraldelectron escapefrom supposedli sooth pan pipe to ambient rainforest sound we are all accustom to the stock idea of soundscap as a calm backdrop
but of cours the sound that each of us find rest are by definit a person thing and there is no onesizefitsal soundtrack that will promot peac for alljust as the stoic emphasis perspect and how small each of us is compar to the whole of the cosmo electron music artist georg fitzgerald look to the univers and the star for inspir for hi 2022 album stellar drift
the musician told musictech to me space repres the furthest point away the grandest vision of human
fitzgerald spent time in new mexico drive in the desert and stargaz
space get you out of yourself
it remind you that we'r tini and insignific
he took imag of the univers collect by nasa and by feed them into new softwar programm convert them into sound which he then develop into the 10 track on the album
he also use audio record from probe that were float around the solar systemelectron garag and hous music have for decad been a form of escap first evolv in the interest margin of societi and unit dispar group
and accord to fitzgerald the star in the sky are an escap one that connect all of us
probabl the most calm track on the album is set sun to be enjoy not necessarili on a busi dancefloor but rather lie on a sofa or stand on a hillsid contempl the vast of the univers – and our own insignificancehilma af klint' the ten largest group iv no

a swedish mystic and painter af klint develop her own lexicon of pastelhu shape sever year ahead of other more fete abstract artist
an exhibit thi april at london' tate modern will explor her work alongsid that of piet mondrian
at the heart of both of their artist journey wa a share desir to understand the forc behind life on earth say the tateaf klint began her career as a landscap painter inspir by natur and then her work began to repres natur form that veer toward abstract
spiritu theosophi and philosophi were central to her outther vision and her work reflect that sens of someth bigger than us at play – in fact she actual believ her work were paint under the direct of higher spirit
like other befor her she view our exist as onli a small element in the larger scheme of thingsundeni woowoo though her vision wa her interest in metaphys and theosophi wa intric even semiscientif and with it own intern logic – she wa drawn to both the spiritualist write of the founder of the theosoph societi madam blavatski and the philosoph idea of the mediev mystic christian rosenkreuz
she want her work to facilit spiritu mediat that would transcend physic realiti and to visualis a kind of astral worldwho know the precis motiv or mean behind these extraordinari limin enigmat artwork
and perhap that mysteri and otherworldli is what make the act of look at them to some of us at least such a profoundli peac experienceharmoni of haikuth tradit form of japanes poetri haiku which consist of 17 syllabl in three line is wide consid to have a calm effect on the reader
the structur of haiku follow a strict syllabl count and it encourag the poet to focu on a singl imag or moment which in itself ha a medit effect
the use of natur imageri in haiku also evok feel of seren and peac
the breviti and simplic of haiku allow the reader to contempl and consid the mean and the imageri without feel overwhelm by excess idea and languagematsuo bashō of the edo period the best known haiku poet – hi complet poetri is translat in the book on love and barley haiku of basho – wa born in igaueno near kyoto in 1644 and he began write vers while act as a companion to a local aristocrat
bashō wa not onli a master of haiku but also a buddhist monk and a great travel – when he travel he reli entir on the hospit of templ and fellow poet
hi gnomic poem combin the zen idea of a one with creation with kurami or light of touch
each of hi poem evok a scene from the natur world – a leap frog a summer moon cherri blossom winter snow – which suggest the small of human life in the context of the vast of natur
pithi and spare hi most famou haiku is the old pond old pond a frog jump in – the sound of water
anoth is a leafless branch on a leafless branch a crow come to rest – autumn nightfallbashō led a solitari life complet free from possess
arguabl hi haiku are the result of a keen eye and a medit mind that have been left clear from the distract of stuff and so he is more aliv to the beauti of the world around him – and closer to hi own intuitionth wander poet matsuo bashō wa the master of haiku – he renounc all belong and travel far and wide find inspir credit getti imagesa daisetz t suzuki write in zen in the japanes cultur a haiku doe not express idea but… put forward imag reflect intuit
these imag are not figur represent made use of by the poetic mind but they directli point to origin intuit inde they are intuit themselv
the suggest is that the composit of haiku is so intuit it is almost unconscioushaiku and their close attent to the detail of natur are part of the wider japanes concept of nagomi and ikigai which roughli translat equat to a sens of mean and harmoni
haiku give us an insight into whi the word ikigai exist in japanes write yukari mitsuhashi in ikigai give everi day mean and joy
in our everyday live whether we are immers ourselv in natur or devour tradit japanes food pay attent to detail grab our focu on to what is right in front of us instead of wonder about our todo list in our head… permit us to find joy and ikigai in simpl everyday thing
and the principl of haiku can be calm when appli to other area of life too
in hi book goodby thing funio sasaki write tradit paint have few figur in them and valu neg space
japanes calligraphi and brush paint are in black and white
haiku is the shortest poem form in the world
these are a few exampl of a minimalist aesthet in japanes art and cultur
in the book sasaki like bashō all those centuri befor decid to give away most of hi possess and explor the feel of calm and tranquil that result there are more thing to gain from elimin excess than you might imagin time space freedom and energi for exampl
find your flowcalm is regard by some with suspicion – is a state of calm realli just a state of passiv
a surrend of engag give up or wors a sociopath disconnectionbut be calm need not equat with be passiv or numb
when we'r absorb in someth we love – music garden draw knit write whatev it is – we can enter an almost trancelik state of calm mesmeris by what we are do
as mitsuhashi argu in her book about ikigai immers ourselv in natur or a particular activ make us focu on what is in front of us free up our mind from other thing and enabl us to find peacein her classic work the artist' way julia cameron encourag the reader to make a commit to quiet time
she write creativ occur in the moment and in the moment we are timelessand author mihali csiksezentmihalyi argu that what realli make us feel not onli calm and peac but also glad to be aliv is unlock a more fulfil state of be
he call thi state of mind flow
in hi book flow the psycholog of happi he throw light on the idea that mani philosoph befor him have posit – that the way to peac doesn't lie in mindless detach but in mind challeng

culture,"eeri ha long been a sensat that we have understood as intang an eeri locat or situat is one where a person can feel frighten or unsettl for reason beyond their comprehens
in that way there is some overlap between the eeri and sigmund freud' feel of da unheimlich or the uncanni where unspecifi familiar with an event render it unnervingmor like thi – the strang allur of ancient stone circl – the magic master of british literatur – the classic thriller that demonis rural folkbut while eeri is by it veri natur elus the eeri is someth that over the last decad or so particularli critic and academ have tri to defin more thoroughli particularli in relat to art
now it is understood as the foundat of a bodi of work that commonli deal in haunt landscap and unexplain dreadeni men centr on a lone volunt on a cornish island record it plant life – but unravel in her isol credit steve tannerin a 2015 essay for the guardian author robert macfarlan identifi a particular trend in english art that he classifi as the english eeri
the eeri as defin by macfarlan is an intersect between rural landscap and that form of fear that is felt first as uneas then as dread and which is incit by glimps and tremor rather than outright attack
he conclud that horror specialis in confront and aggress the eeri in intim and aggreg
the english eeri can be detect in a varieti of work in the fiction of mr jame alan garner and benjamin myer on televis in show like the bbc' ghost stori at christma and cult children' fantasi seri children of the stone 1977 and in art by the like of derek jarman tacita dean and paul nashth work of filmmak mark jenkin also fit under thi umbrella
for over two decad the director ha creat uniqu haunt film notabl among other thing for the fact that they are shot on celluloid it homedevelop imperfect sit in stark contrast to the digitis of film cultur sinc the turn of the millennium
break through to bigger audienc in 2020 with the baftawin bait the director return thi year with the equal disquiet eni menjenkin ha a second preoccup alongsid hi analogu sensibl the landscap and cultur of hi nativ cornwal
while bait wa a deepli modern tale of cornish gentrif told with old technolog eni men reflect that same local interest but with stronger cohes between the old filmic form and it period settingeni men – cornish for stone island and no doubt a refer to the film' mani visual of stand stone – is set on a mysteri isl off the cornish coast in the 1970
it concern a volunt mari woodvin as she goe about her life in an isol cottag
she spend her day keep track of some of the island' plant life and tend the gener that suppli her cottag with power and she ha brief moment of human contact via radio and a visit local sailor edward row
soon ghostli vision haunt her featur the island' mine past as well as shard of her own life
ha the solitud driven her into a state of nightmarish delus or is someth beyond her understand rise from the landbbc cultur spoke to jenkin about hi new film and the preoccup of hi work
i wa a rural kid he suggest when ask of hi influenc and i suppos i alway seem to be attract to the dark side of thing a desir to be a bit scare but to also look at the flip side of the idyl
part of that is a reaction against the way that cornwal is idealis and romanticis
jenkin' film is a perfect antiromant express of cornish eeri
there is certainli a level of abstract that come from shoot smallgaug film he say of hi trusti bolex 16mm camera but most of the eeri come later in the process in how the imag bump up against each other and most importantli how the sound work with and against the image”th subvers mission of 'eerie' arta identifi by macfarlan and other the eeri act as a kind of countertradit to the romant pastor of english art rather than portray the english countrysid as a place of chocolatebox fantasi it ha often zone in on specif rural local and tri to convey their haunt essenc that are beyond the understand of urbanit considerationsin do so eeri art can be polit accord to macfarlan there is often a dissent left polit at work
eeri work resist the picturepostcard vision of rural england and mark it as a site of violenc and trauma histor and contemporan
the countrysid of the eeri is the locat of previou class struggl such as the fight against the enclosur act – the 1773 act that effect made huge swath of common land privat – and gerrard winstanley' rebellion of digger who continu to work on land that wa privatis by the act
inde kevin brownlow and andrew mollo’ film about thi episod winstanley 1975 is an especi fit exampl of such polit charg eeri work
equal the battl over green space continu to influenc eeri work to thi day with protest and campaign argu for people' right to roam over the land and the continu assault upon the environ by a myriad of industriesrequiem for a villag 1976 wa part of a wave of 1970 british film that mix a documentarystyl depict of the countrysid with eeri element credit bfiwithin eeri work slow dread is also prefer over direct confront which is precis the atmospher of eni men
the first half of jenkin' film is method and patient build on the main character' ritualist engag with the landscap
i can't help but captur the landscap around me say jenkin
the film reli on an authent portray of thi specif place and as it is set on an appar desert island in mani way there isn't much els to captur
again and again jenkin film the volunt studi plant on the rocki coastlin befor her routin of find a stone to drop into the dark of an old mine shaft
the character' engag with the landscap trigger memori from her past and the island'sdr kati soar from the univers of winchest ha research the eeri with particular regard to it relationship to landscap and histori and with refer to the work of eeri author arthur machen
landscap is an actor in the eeri she tell bbc cultur not just a stage it play a part in the narr rather than simpli provid a backdrop for it
soar' idea sit comfort with jenkin' film especi in it depict of a tempor unstabl landscap where differ period of time merg and meet
a landscap is never finish or fix soar say
thi lack of stabil can caus profound uneas and as such these caprici landscap provid a threat which is often the catalyst for eeri event
it is onli later in eni men that more horrifi vision enter and even then they seem abstract compar to the definit visit of more typic horror
sometim these vision and atmospher aris for onli a second befor vanish and with littl indic that they were there at all
women in tradit cloth move in unison on the cliff top lichen grow from an old scar on the volunteer' bodi and the face of miner peer out of the dark of old shaftsthes vision are eeri not simpli becaus they are deriv from the rural landscap but becaus they onli intim their presenc they are glimps terror
the eeri resist reveal it horror head on
the mood of the eeri is linger soar believ a sensat that is hard to shake off
the eeri doesn't deal in jump scare but involv a nag troubl sens of doubt and uncertainti that colour all activ
in hi essay the weird and the eeri 2016 the academ mark fisher defin eeri as constitut by a failur of absenc or by a failur of presenc
that is for fisher the eeri occur either when there is someth present where there should be noth or if there is noth present when there should be someth
eni men fall into the former camp where the island should be absenc made manifest but instead provid spectr of class trauma break the volunteer' solitud
the local industri and it demis is the most unsettl ghost of the filmth lineag of eeri cinemaemphasis that eni men is far from the first film to explor the english and more specif the cornish landscap in such an eeri manner a season of film curat by jenkin will be screen at the british film institut in london
what mani of hi choic show is continu between eni men and previou eeri work beli the simplist descript of folk horror – a more obvious aggress genr in which landscap folklor and superstit are weaponis to produc violenc and supernatur happen – that jenkin' film ha been assign in mani reviewseni men feel closer to a branch of cinema that is subtler and more concern with unnam halfintuit dread than the direct confront of folk horror
it may be easi to liken the film to robin hardy' the wicker man 1973 and pier haggard' the blood on satan' claw 1971 – two of british folk horror' most recognis film – but the cinema it realli feel indebt to is much quietersculptor barbara hepworth is perhap the most famou artist to captur the eeri of the cornish landscap in her work credit alamyth 1970 saw a wealth of film deal with the decidedli strang atmospher of english landscap in a similar fashion – film such as david gladwell' requiem for a villag 1976 peter hall' akenfield 1974 both set in suffolk and philip trevelyan' sussexcentr documentari the moon and the sledgehamm 1971
all of these mix documentari aesthet and a desir to captur life in the countrysid with stranger element whether it be peopl rise from their grave as in gladwell' film or overlap time period as in hall'ssever more recent eeri film feel in tune with jenkin' too
ben rivers' medit two year at sea 2012 share some crossov thank to it homedevelop 16mm visual and empti landscap river and jenkin are share a stage at the bfi later thi month to discuss their work as do sever experiment landscap film of recent year such as gideon koppel' sleep furious 2008 andrew kötting' by our selv 2015 and paul wright' arcadia 2017especi import to jenkin is the children' film foundat short haunter of the deep 1984 by andrew bogl
the cff wa a nonprofit uk organis that produc children' film for saturday morn matine screen from the late 1940 to the 1980
a spooki tale about a haunt mine that wa set on the cornish coastlin haunter of the deep feel especi poignant as an influenc as jenkin enthus it share a locat with eni men and also some subject matter
i rememb see the film when i wa young and be freak out by some of the imag
they have realli stay with me and i’v paid homag to one of them
look beyond these screen influenc continu can also be drawn between jenkin' film and eeri work in other media that is similarli focus on cornwal
with it array of menhir humanproduc upright stand stone dot the landscap and rich folklor the locat ha inspir mani artist
eileen agar use cornish landscap as well as physic debri from the coastlin to make an incred array of eeri and esoter work across mani form while sculptor barbara hepworth play off the stand stone and shape within the cornish landscap to creat a celebr catalogu of eeri sculptur
even novel such as over sea under stone 1965 by susan cooper recognis the eeri potenti of the locat
and then wrote cooper loom over the dark brow of the headland they saw the outlin of the stand stones… as they drew nearer the stone seem to grow point silent to the sky like vast tombston set on end
she could easili be describ visual seen in eni men
my filmmak is an ongo attempt to make sens of the world and specif the littl bit of it where i happen to live jenkin conclud
i have a continu obsess with make signific the seemingli insignific simpli by film it
yet fisher’ own conclus suggest that to make sens of the world through the eeri is ultim an imposs as it concern the unknown when knowledg is achiev the eeri disappearsfor fisher the eeri is perceiv but unknow
in jenkin' attempt to understand hi person local eni men may success and beauti transmut the unspeak eeri of cornwal into spectral crackl of celluloid but we may never truli know or face it lurk horror head oneni men is releas in the uk on 13 januari

at best the last decad ha produc wellcraft famili fare such as sonic the hedgehog and detect pikachu at worst the genr ha found itself defin by a string of cynic mediocr and unwatch failur
the challeng tend to be twofold
video game themselv – while capabl of tell compel stori on their own term – do not translat natur to movi and tv show while the peopl in charg of financ or make those movi and tv show have been known to have littl respect for what make them worth adapt in the first place
neither of which is the case for hbo' remark ninepart adapt of the last of us gener regard as one of the greatest video game stori ever told
more like thi – 11 tv show to watch thi january– how the apocalyps is be reimagined– the most controversi show of 2022origin releas in 2013 the last of us is set amidst the ravag of a postapocalypt us 20 year after a parasit fungu call cordycep ha turn most of the popul into mindless monster
it follow a harden smuggler name joel play in the show by pedro pascal who ha been task with escort across the countri elli bella ramsey a teenag girl with an appar rare immun to the infect
in an interview with the new yorker creator neil druckmann recal how in 2014 a film adapt fell through becaus execut want to make it bigger and sexier like the brad pitt film world war z
the game howev offer a more intim stori
it is a charact studi of astonish depth offer around 15 hour of gameplay
it burn dark violent slow thick with an atmospher of melancholi and dread heavili influenc by the aesthet of prestig televis and cinema
druckmann himself ha referenc the coen brother film no countri for old men as a touchston
it is an essenc that ha been captur deftli in thi smallscreen iter by both druckmann and coshowrunn craig mazin the writer behind the similarli dark and atmospher 2019 hbo drama chernobyl
it is a faith adapt in everyth from look to score to feel with the earli episod in particular follow the game almost beatforbeat
we meet love father joel on the day of the outbreak as he desper tri to keep hi daughter sarah nico parker safe from a chaotic crumbl texa
the infect are fast and rabid at first but cut to 20 year later and the cordycep ha spread from the brain to all over the bodi creat an array of monstros
the most terrifi of which are clicker whose fungicov eye mean that they possess supersensit hear
the way they screech the way they jerk the way they forc you to stay absolut still is a horror to beholdit is around thi time that we'r reintroduc to an older more grizzl joel chang by the thing he ha had to do to surviv
he work as a smuggler food ammunit drug in a quarantin zone in boston where life is tough resourc are scarc and the remnant of the govern – now run by fedra feder disast respons agenc heavili base on real us govern agenc fema feder emerg manag agenc – rule with an iron fist
pascal is not as rug as video game joel but hi perform is raw and haunt
he is a man hollow out by grief who ha buri hi human and cheer beneath mound of cynic and violenc
but pascal is also a sensit soul actor and see joel soften and thaw throughout the seri is one of it great pleasuresth reason for thi chang is elli who joel must deliv to a group call the firefli – a revolutionari militia fight to bring down fedra and restor democraci – in the hope that they can use her immun to develop a vaccin
the show essenti live or die on the cast of elli who is as play and profan as she is endearingli obnoxi
thank bella ramsey best known for her brief turn as lyanna mormont in game of throne steal everi scene she is in
her elli is a loveabl littl terror full of charisma and bravado serv as the perfect foil to pascal' stoicism
there' a real wit and warmth to the write too as elli gradual break down joel’ defenc with her favourit book of bad pun
can i ask you a seriou question
she whisper in the dark as both of them tri to sleep in the wood whi did the scarecrow get an award
the humour is much need in the bleak violent world that they travers where peopl are just as danger as the infect
the video game which is split into four season across a year is episod in natur with most locat featur a subplot sketch out in letter and memento that the player find
the show build upon these letter and flesh them out into fullyform stori
and it is here when druckmann and mazin are at their most audaci in term of creativ licenc that the last of us truli sing as televisionepisod three for exampl turn a seri of bitter letter between two men call bill and frank impli to be lover into the most tender of romanc
set across two decad it follow paranoid prepper bill nick offerman as he strike up a relationship with frank the white lotus' murray bartlett a man who stumbl into one of hi mani trap
what follow is a beauti exquisit perform explor of the last of us' central theme that the ash of the world are enough as long as there is someon to live for amongst themit is a sentiment that is turn insideout in episod four and five which follow joel and elli as they make their way through the aftermath of a bloodi upris against an especi fascist branch of fedra in kansa citi
the superb melani lynskey yellowjacket featur here as the chillingli violent and veng leader of the revolut
she want all collabor execut with a special emphasi on a man call henri lamar johnson who murder her brother
these episod also featur some of the show' best action sequenc includ a huge setpiec involv the infect that is as grisli and grip as ani in the gameit is not a perfect adapt
there are certain scene earli on that feel too gamey for televis such as those where joel and elli are sneak around a museum while the latter half of the seri feel like it need one more episod to even out the pace scene involv the infect are strang scarc beyond episod five
there is also the fact that no onscreen adapt of the last of us will ever truli captur what make the sourc materi so interest to be immers in that world to luxuri in space that feel haunt by absenc to be eaten aliv by a clickerand yet it doesn't feel even remot controversi to call thi the best video game adapt ever made
for fan of the game it is an adapt of the utmost skill and rever yet one still capabl of surpris for peopl who have never pick up a control it is an encapsul of the game' heart and soul – it fullblood charact it neat plot it matur theme of love and loss

future,"at first glanc saliva seem like pretti bore stuff mere a conveni way to moisten our food
but the realiti is quit differ as scientist are begin to understand
the fluid interact with everyth that enter the mouth and even though it is 99 water it ha a profound influenc on the flavour – and our enjoy – of what we eat and drink
it is a liquid but it' not just a liquid say oral biologist guy carpent of king' colleg londonscientist have long understood some of saliva' function it protect the teeth make speech easier and establish a welcom environ for food to enter the mouth
but research are now find that saliva is also a mediat and a translat influenc how food move through the mouth and how it spark our sens
emerg evid suggest that interact between saliva and food may even help to shape which food we like to eatth substanc is not veri salti which allow peopl to tast the salti of a potato chip
it' not veri acid which is whi a spritz of lemon can be so stimul
the fluid' water and salivari protein lubric each mouth of food and it enzym such as amylas and lipas kickstart the process of digestionthi wet also dissolv the chemic compon of tast or tastant into saliva so they can travel to and interact with the tast bud
through saliva say jiansh chen a food scientist at zhejiang gongshang univers in hangzhou china we detect chemic inform of food the flavour the tast
you might also likechen coin the term food oral process in 2009 to describ the multidisciplinari field that draw on food scienc the physic of food materi the body' physiolog and psycholog respons to food and more a subject he wrote about in the 2022 annual review of food scienc and technolog
when peopl eat he explain they don't actual savour the food itself but a mixtur of the food plu saliva
for exampl an eater can perceiv a sweet or sourtast molecul in a bite of food onli if that molecul can reach the tast bud – and for that to happen it must pass through the layer of saliva that coat the tonguethat' not a given say carpent who point to how flat soda tast sweeter than fizzi soda
research had assum thi wa becaus burst bubbl of carbon dioxid in fresh soda provid an acid hit that essenti distract the brain from the sweet
but when carpent and hi colleagu studi the process in the lab in a sort of artifici mouth they found that saliva prevent the soda' bubbl from flow between tongu and palat
carpent think these backedup bubbl could physic block the sugar from reach the tast receptor on the tongu
with flat soda no bubbl build up to block the sweet tastefood scientist jiansh chen say saliva help transfer chemic inform from food like the refresh zing of lemon to tastebud credit flavia morlachettigetti imagessaliva can also affect the aroma – which are respons for the vast major of our percept of flavour – that aris from food in the mouth
as we chew some flavour molecul in the food dissolv in the saliva but those that don't can waft up into the nasal caviti to be sens by the myriad receptor there
as a result peopl with differ salivari flow rate or differ saliva composit – especi of protein call mucin – may have veri differ flavour experi from the same food or beveragefor exampl spanish research measur the flow of saliva in 10 volunt who evalu wine to which fruityflavour ester had been ad
volunt who produc more saliva tend to score the flavour as more intens possibl becaus they swallow more often and thu forc more aroma into their nasal passag the scientist found
so wine enthusiast proud of their abil to detect nuanc of aroma may have their spit to thank at least in partsaliva also play a star role in our percept of textur
take astring that dri feel that happen in the mouth when you drink red wine or eat unrip fruit
the wine doesn't actual make your mouth drier
instead molecul call tannin in the wine can caus protein to precipit out of the saliva so that it no longer lubric as effectivelysaliva also help us to perceiv the differ between highfat and lowfat food
even if two yoghurt look the same and pour the same a lowfat version feel drier in the mouth say anwesha sarkar a food scientist at the uk' univers of leed
what you'r tri to understand is not the properti of the food but how the food is interact with the surfac of the mouth sarkar say
milk fat can combin with saliva to creat a layer of droplet that can mask astring and add a feel of rich to the yoghurt she sayssarkar' research use a mechan tongu bath in artifici saliva as a way to simul what happen as food move through the mouth and how that influenc the sensori experi of eat
a smoothi with lower fat sarkar say might look creami at first glanc but will lack the textur luxuri that fat provid upon mix with salivawin aficionado proud of their abil to detect flavour might have their saliva to thank – at least partli credit westend61getti images understand these interact between saliva food and the mouth – and how the inform transfer to the brain – could lead to the design of healthier food say sarkar
she envis develop a gradient food that might includ enough sugar on the outsid of the food to dissolv in saliva to give a sens of sweet but it would be at a lower concentr and calori level in the whole food
she say a similar conceptu approach could help reduc fat in foodsbut understand these interact well enough to develop such food won't be easi becaus saliva and percept vari throughout the day and between individu
gener saliva flow slowli in the morn and fastest in the earli afternoon
and the compon of ani individual' saliva – the amount of certain protein for exampl – will vari throughout the day and in the presenc or absenc of stimuli such as tantalis aromasor biochemist elsa lami of the univers of évora in portug investig thi by blindfold volunt let them smell a piec of bread for about four minut while monitor their saliva for chang
two type of protein starchdigest amylas and other call cystatin that have been link to tast sensit and percept increas after exposur to the bread she found
lamy' group ha done similar experi with vanilla and lemon and in all case found chang in the level of saliva protein though the specif chang depend on the food present
her team is now work to understand what function thi may serveth makeup of saliva vari from person to person – and that depend partli on an individual' past food choic say annmari torregrossa a behaviour neuroscientist at the univers at buffalo
when torregrossa fed rat diet contain bittertast addit she observ notic increas in multipl categori of saliva protein
as those chang happen rat becam more like to accept the bitter in their food
the way we think about thi is if you eat broccoli all the time broccoli doesn't tast bad to you say torregrossain anoth experi torregrossa use cathet to transfer saliva collect from rat that were accustom to eat bitter diet into the mouth of rat that were not
the naiv anim becam more toler of bitter food despit their lack of exposur
but control anim that weren't suppli with the pumpedin bitternesstoler saliva protein still reject the bitter foodtorregrossa say she and her team have yet to figur out exactli which protein are respons for thi toler
they have a coupl of like candid includ prolinerich protein and proteas inhibitor but there could be other
they need to know which protein are involv befor they can assess how respons to bitter flavour are be tweak in the mouth and the brainth bubbl in soda drink may help mask the sweet of drink which becom more pronounc when they go flat credit catherin fall commercialgetti imagesof cours rat aren't peopl – but research have found hint that saliva is do similar thing to tast percept in peopl though the pictur is more complic
there are a lot of other thing in human diet and experi that are influenc our daytoday experi particularli with food and flavour that rodent just do not have to deal with say lissa davi a sensori and nutrit scientist at purdu univers who studi tast and behaviourbut if these pattern can be decod and understood the potenti is great say lami
if you could somehow provid kid with an addit that encourag chang to their saliva and therefor make their experi with a bitter veget more palat it could encourag healthier eat
if their first experi with a new food isn't accompani by a high level of bitter she say probabl they will associ a good experi with that vegetablemor broadli build a better understand of how saliva influenc tast – and how diet in turn influenc the composit of saliva – could open up a host of new way to nudg dietari prefer toward healthi food that are often revil
how say torregrossa can we turn the hater into peopl who love these food

future,"when i wa five year old my grandmoth gave my younger sister and me a pictur book which outlin in detail how a man and a woman have sex to creat a babyw were enthral
until thi point our onli refer point for where babi came from wa disney' dumbo be deliv to hi mother by a storkmi embarrass mum place the book on a high shelf hope that would be the end of it
my sister and i of cours climb on a chair to get it and continu perus the pictur giggl and point incredul at the nake bodi as my parent awkwardli tri to dodg our barrag of questionsmi parent had the talk with me a few year later when they thought i wa the right age​​ to learn the truth about sex childbirth and puberti
sex educ wa also part of the curriculum at both the dutch and english primari school i attend
but mani children across the world aren't properli taught about sex until they get to secondari school if at all
there are definit still plenti of children who are get folk stori or mythic answer about where babi come from say luci emmerson chief execut of the sex educ forum in the ukcould such myth and euphem – whether they are classic tale of babi deliv by stork or found in cabbag field or more modern spontan invent – actual affect our attitud to sex in the long run
and how did they come to be in the first place
a closer look at some of the oldest folk stori about sex and babi reveal fascin insight into whi peopl tell them – and how we might do betterin scotland children place cabbag leav outsid their home to ask fairi to bring them a new sibl credit emmanuel lafontth babyst cranegrow up i wa frequent confront with the stork tale
disney film cartoon and pictur book all told me that newborn babi were found and deliv to their parent by these eleg longleg bird
the origin myth howev ha a darker twist with the bird steal – or rescu depend on your perspect – the babyth myth can be trace back to ancient greec where crane which share mani similar with stork were associ with steal babi
in greek mytholog hera the goddess of childbirth turn her rival gerana into a crane with an elong neck becaus she wa have an affair with her husband zeu
unwil to part with her newborn child gerana pick up the babi wrap it in a blanket and flew off with the infant in her beakov time the crane wa conflat with the stork say paul quinn senior lectur in english literatur at the univers of chichest in the uk
there' a link with domest becaus stork nest on people' roof
anoth mytholog layer wa ad by the pelican which in european mediev literatur wa a symbol for the virgin mari and the nurtur mother say quinn
the pelican wa also associ with breastfeed he say as the bird is describ as pick at it chest to feed it chick in literaturebi the earli 19th centuri the stork start appear in fairytal
again it tend to appear as a symbol of domest life and the famili
stork have alway been associ with famili life becaus they were visibl seen nurs their young say marina warner professor of english and creativ write at birkbeck colleg univers of london
in fairytal they often come to the rescu of human babi
the stork find babi in well pond or marsh and with her beak she pull the babi out and bundl them in a sling say warnerthi version wa popularis by han christian andersen' stori the stork which wa publish in the earli 19th centuri
in andersen' tale the white bird seek out the pond in which all the littl children lie wait till the stork come to take them to their parent
the prettiest littl babi lie there dream more sweetli than they will ever dream in the time to come andersen write
all parent are glad to have a littl child and children are so pleas with a littl brother or sister
but there is a cruel twist to andersen' stori badli behav children are given a dead babi sibl by the stork as punish to make them cri over their littl dead brotherdespit thi horrif end andersen' tale quickli swept through the englishspeak world
in victorian britain the stork becam a use way for embarrass parent to explain the fact of life to their children and conceal the realiti of sex and childbirth say warnerin it benign form the stork myth still linger in popular cultur
to thi day a common birthmark on a newborn' skin caus by blood vessel malform is still call a stork bite highlight the tale' influencea similar confluenc of ancient belief and parent squeamish lie behind anoth colour myth about how babi are born the idea that they are grown in cabbag patchesth cabbag patch myth possibl origin in variou belief and practic around plant and fertil
in scotland it wa common for children to place cabbag leav outsid their home if they were ask fairi to bring them a new sibl say quinn
women also use to eat cabbag to boost their fertil and ensur a success pregnanc he saysjust like the child rescu by the stork the cabbag patch babi is found in natur and discov as part of the natur world say warner
in french the term of endear for a young child is mon petit chou my littl cabbag she notesth stori also lend itself to sweet childfriendli illustr
a seri of postcard publish in 1906 by three sister in new zealand show a garden tend to a field of babi grow in cabbag patch
welldress edwardian coupl are shown wander among the field brows the babi grow there
the garden pick the chosen cabbag babi and present it to the coupl
similar tale of children be grown in garden and orchard exist around the world such as a muchlov japanes folk myth about a boy emerg from a peachfor victorian parent tale featur the stork and cabbag patch babi offer a way to explain thing to their children that they couldn't explain to them otherwis say quinn
they didn't know what a femal bodi look like insid … they just imagin it to be an invert male bodi he say
so how do you explain that
the natur world is the obviou model to go to
for victorian the stori of littl red ride hood contain an import messag about the risk of talk to stranger credit emmanuel lafontwarn agre a lot of parent wouldn't have understood their own anatomi and would have realli struggl to explain the fact of life to their children
the tale provid a handi answer
but parent also use them to transmit code messag about sex and relationship she saystak littl red ride hood a european fairi tale about a girl who goe to visit her granni and on the way stop to talk to a seemingli friendli wolf
dure the victorian age parent would tell their daughter thi fairytal to warn them not to interact with men they didn't know say warner
thi wa befor women had access to ani contracept so when it came to romanc and premarit sex the danger were veri great she say
there wa also real social shame associ with unmarri pregnanc she addsharm mythswhil the babydeliv stork remain a popular motif on greet card and gift it may be hard to imagin 21st centuri parent serious tri to persuad their children that thi is how babi are born
but other myth and euphem are still surprisingli common say spring chenoa cooper associ professor of sexual health at the citi univers of new york school of public health
one reason is simpli that mani parent are still unsur when and how to talk about the fact
a lot of peopl don't know the actual scientif thing they should be say and they don't know how to explain sex to their children
howev euphem that feel comfort and safe for parent in the moment can in fact be confus for children say emmerson at the sex educ forum in the uk
parent may find it difficult to correct the stori later and admit that they lie
she recount how an 18yearold girl visit a sexual health clinic to ask whether she could be pregnant after semen land in her belli button
she wa engag in a relationship but she didn't understand sexual health or her own anatomi say emmersoncoop agre that when peopl make assumpt base on myth and misinform it can have harm resultsin australia the hpv vaccin which is given to young peopl to prevent cervic cancer wa commonli refer to as the sex vaccin
thi led some girl to wrongli believ that it protect them from sexual transmit diseas and meant they and their partner did not need to use condom say cooperanoth danger of use euphem is that it can set a pattern of not discuss sex openli expert say make it difficult for children and teen to confid in their parent
they might experi assault and feel they cannot speak up about it get pregnant and not tell anybodi or get a sexual transmit diseas and not treat it say cooper
the fear of talk about these thing can caus ramif for their whole live
the stork stori can be trace back to ancient greek myth about crane transport babi credit emmanuel lafontthi articl is part of famili tree a seri that explor the issu and opportun famili around the world face today – and how they'll shape tomorrow
you might also likeclimb other branch of the famili tree with bbc cultur and worklifefrom stork to cup of tea school may not necessarili fix such gap and misunderstand
in the us just 29 of the 50 state mandat sex educ
accord to the center for diseas control and prevent fewer than half of high school and less than onefifth of middl school teach key topic for sex educ
in the uk children are taught about relationship in primari school but it is not compulsori for primari school to provid sex educ class which onli becom mandatori at secondari schoolbut emmerson say some school resourc in the uk are fail to properli teach children about sexon exampl is the video consent it' simpl as tea which wa creat by thame valley polic and is wide shown in school she say
the video liken initi sex to offer to make someon a cup of tea and remind young peopl that someon want a cup of tea or sex one day doesn't automat mean they want it anoth dayemmerson say she ha receiv complaint from young peopl that the video is too euphemist and fail to refer to sex at all
so if a parent wa think 'if i say noth they'r go to understand that when they arriv at school' that is probabl not the case say emmersonit seem that my grandma wa right then in give me that pictur book about sex and babi
but for parent who can't quit imagin that level of open and factual detail research suggest start small with short simpl chat rather than a big talk
it is about anticip rather than be caught out say emmerson
it' about realis that a lot of opportun will present themselv befor recept or nurseri to give their children some vocabulari around their bodi and also around their emot
for exampl if a young child ask how babi are born it' enough to say that the babi grow in the mother' tummi and come out of the vagina she say
it' not about explain sexual intercours
it' just about provid a factual respons that isn't a fabric
whenev a child ask you a question about sex answer it veri simpli and directli say cooper
you don't need to sit them down and lectur them for an hour… that might scare them to ask more about it
vital concept like consent and boundari can be taught from the start
for exampl you can tell toddler to check befor hug other and explain to them whi ask for consent is import she saysdo that mean there' no place for charm stori about stork and cabbag in modern parent cultur
the answer might be perhap to enjoy these folk tale for what they are – colour feat of the imagin hand down by previou gener
in ani case my grandma' book delight and entertain me as much as ani fairi tale – and wa certainli more thrill than the stori of the stork

future,"one day harold antoin de voeux realis he lack a word
it wa the begin of the 20th centuri and the doctor had been treat multipl peopl for lung ailment
gradual he figur out the reason for the excess ill he wa see it wa the air pollut caus by nearbi factori burn so much coal
in one 1909 incid that affect glasgow more than 1000 peopl had diedther wa no name for thi pollut so de voeux coin one smog – a portmanteau of smoke and fog
he didn't ask for permiss
he didn't consult a linguist
he just put it in hi paper and announc it say heidi quant an artist who specialis in new environment vocabulari
it becam a neolog becaus peopl were desper to name what wa in the air
­it wouldn't be the last time that a new word wa need to describ environment chang
it' whi quant and her fellow artist alicia escott have spent almost a decad collect and creat new word to defin the experi of live in the anthropocen which of cours is itself a neolog popularis in the 2000
quant and escott call their project the bureau of linguist realiti and their goal is to cocreat a new lexicon for a time of climat chang biodivers collaps and other transform in the natur world
through public particip and popup instal at place like climat summit they ask peopl to help them come up with brand new vocabulari
you might not have use word like nonnapaura chuco헐sol or preuphoreau befor – but you may do soonyou may also likequant and escott have been work on the bureau of linguist realiti sinc 2014
a found motiv for the pair wa a belief that the discuss of climat chang need to be participatori not a oneway lectur
one of the thing that frustrat me so much while work for major environment group is thi concept that there are anoint peopl who 'know' and there are peopl who are 'not knowing' say quant
but with the bureau everyon ha knowledg if you have a feel you have knowledg if you have an experi you have knowledg
so quant and escott see it as import to work with member of the public to coin word rather than dream up new vocabulari on their owncaptur the conflict fear and hope of becom a grandpar amid climat chang nonnapaura come from italian credit javier hirschfeldto illustr how the pair tell the stori of how the word nonnapaura wa coin
at an event they attend a woman call linda ruth cutt came up to them and explain an emot about climat chang that she couldn't quit articul
she said 'i am terrifi for my children… but i'm simultan want to experi grandchildren
i don't know how to share that with them'
it wa simultan hope and fear say quanteso work with cutt they turn to italian combin the word nonna grandmoth and paura fear nonnapaurainde much of the inspir for their word come from nonenglish tongu
i grew up speak three languag and wa alway frustrat that the english languag wa so anaem compar to french or other where there' a lot more emot say quanteanoth nonenglish neolog came from a convers with two young peopl of el salvadorian and korean origin in lo angel
there had been some tension between their respect commun explain escott so they want a word that help remind them of what they had in common
they came up with chuco헐sol – a mixtur of el salvadorian slang korean and spanish
it essenti mean dirti – wow – sun and describ the lo angel sunseta mixtur of languag chuco헐sol mean dirtywowsun and appli to the pollut lo angel sunset credit javier hirschfeldlo angel ha these gorgeou sunset that are perfect for instagram
they'r orang they'r red
but the reason they'r so beauti is becaus of the pollut in the air explain quant
they want to say 'we all look at the same sun we all experi the same pollution'
they creat a word to embodi thi experi
we didn't ask them to chang their mother tongu we didn't ask them to adher to some rule of the english languag she continu
we let them do it in a way that they felt liter repres what they were tri to say
they got so much joy out of just put these languag togeth
while the bureau of linguist realiti coin mani of it word at live event in convers with peopl it founder do also take submiss
if you have an idea for a word that describ life in the anthropocen complet thi form on it websiteit wouldn't be the onli word that escott and quant would unearth for environment chang in california
in 2018 they and a contributor call jessica decker coin the word pyrora – to describ the air dure californian wildfir when the atmospher take on a differ hue due to the soot particul within itand when the pair visit the commun of pacifica near san francisco they cocreat word about the experi of live on land that wa slowli be eaten away by the ocean
pacifica is on the forefront of navig coastal eros sea level rise and fraught convers around the topic of plan for the futur and 'manag retreat' say escottth term 'mientierra' deriv from spanish describ the way that ground cannot alway be trust or reli upon – it appli to idea or system too credit javier hirschfeldth pair collabor with cindi abbott of the sanchez art center in pacifica as well as the artist kim anno and modesto covarrubia who are both from the san francisco bay area to work with local peopl on new term to describ the situat they are face
togeth they coin term like sandul a verb which mean to understand that the coast is aliv and we can't just build the solid structur that we have respect it say quant
or mientierra – from the spanish mient shehe lie and tierra land
it mean a fals sens of solid ground beneath us say escott to describ the experi of not be abl to trust the land near a retreat coastlin
it could also be appli as a metaphor for contemporari structur and system that seem robust but are notth human relationship with water also inform their word shellaqua which is particularli relev to the recent flood across california
shellaqua is the act of cover a onceperm surfac with humanmad materi like tarmac increas flood risk base on a shellac coat and aqua
but it also ha an allegor mean an individu can shellaqua themselv becom imperm and resist to restor idea and thinkingthen there are the word that describ hubrist or perhap misguid respons to climat chang
one of those is teuchnikskrei which came from a convers with a german engin about the limit of technolog
there' a concept in german call the 'devil' circle' teufelskriei say quant
he switch it to 'teuchnik' referenc the word for technolog technik
so teuchnikskrei is the fals belief that creat technolog will get us out of our mess when in fact our mess is cultur explain quanteanoth is marsif which describ the expans of coloni idea to other planet
it creator – zara zimbardo of the consult partner for collabor chang in california and oaklandbas writeractivist patrick reinsborough – want a word to help them describ what they saw as a mistaken attitud that mar could one day be a refug from climat chang and all of earth' problem
preuphoreau is a hope feel the bodili intuit that refresh rainfal may be come credit javier hirschfeldmi own favourit word from the bureau howev are the more hope one
for exampl the word refuvesc – coin with zimbardo and san franciscobas artist georgia carbon in 2017 – describ a moment when thing take an unexpect turn for the better
it echo the word eucatastroph which i wrote about earlier in the wise word seri but is decidedli more organ in it origin
there is thi moment where compost goe from smell rank to smell sweet and full of life
refuvesc is think about that as a moment within cultur say escotti also like the word preuphoreau coin with scientist faith kearn of the california institut for water resourc which is the bodili feel of sens a chang in the atmospher becaus rain is come
it can also describ a moment of hope anticip that chang is come
it' a mixtur of pre euphoria eau french for waterhop sad overwhelm or pessimist quant and escott argu that when peopl have the opportun to describ their emot with new word they feel more connect to what is happen in the anthropocen
and ultim thi leav them more empow in the face of daunt transform
learn more about the complex emot that climat chang is foster in peopl around the world in our seri climat emot
as quant say a lot of peopl come to us and they say 'oh i final feel like i have a place in the climat conversation' becaus heretofor they would imagin that you have to protest in the street with a sign or you have to be a politician or have to be a scientist
but they have the agenc to be cultureshift through word

leprosi is a chronic infecti diseas attack the skin nerv and mucou membran
thi eventu lead to white patch numb muscular weak and paralysi
but despit it devast consequ and record case possibl stretch back as earli as 1400 bc to thi day much about thi ancient maladi remain mysteri
no one know how leprosi origin nor whi some part of the world are more affect than other
scientist still don't even know for sure how it spread – and there still isn't an easi way to check if someon ha it
take the armadillo
origin nativ to south america thi insect anim is now also found across central america and southern north america
in brazil one of three countri that account for most of the 200000 new leprosi case everi year alongsid india and indonesia armadillo are hunt for meat
one studi by research found 62 of the armadillo kill by hunter were infect with m lepra similar survey in the us – where there are between 150250 new case in human report each year – have found 20 of the anim there carri the bacterium
in the us they have been blame for a rise in case in florida
howev like much about leprosi the degre to which armadillo are respons for spread the diseas in human is characterist unclear
that' not to mention the fact that human may have given these anim the diseas in the first place when european brought it with them to brazil around 500 year ago
whi ha leprosi remain so mysteri – and prove so hard to solv
crucial could thi be about to chang

to catch the diseas earli would mean prevent lifelong disabl
howev these number of children receiv a diagnosi have drop to 80009000 case he say
that mean that there are a lot of children who are in danger of develop the diseas
some countri are show a recoveri but there is still low case detect in countri like myanmar sri lanka philippin
at thi time we'r realli face an acut challeng he say
the world ha made great stride in leprosi treatment in the last four decad especi with the who’ introduct of multidrug therapi to treat multibacillari leprosi in 1982
multibacillari leprosi is a more advanc form of the diseas often characteris by skin lesion and disabl
one new treatment is multidrug therapi mdt – a combin of three pill two of which are taken onc a month and anoth daili
it ha had a huge impact in term of stop the progress of the diseas bring us as close to a cure as may be possibl and prevent disabl among those who are affect
but it hasn't been abl to stop new case from emerg explain venkata pemmaraju act team leader of the who global leprosi programm and who ha been work on leprosi relat issu for the past four decad
old challengesso what make thi ancient diseas so persist
accord to sunkara there are a number of factor involv
for one m lepra replic extrem slowli so it can take between two and 20 year befor an infect person show ani symptom of the diseas
the averag incub time the time between exposur to the bacteria and symptom first appear for the diseas is five year and in rare case a patient may have no symptom for two decad
it' not yet possibl to grow the bacteria that caus leprosi in a petri dish so research use armadillo to studi it credit getti imagesthi bacteria ha a longer incub time say sunkara
it take about 14 day for one bacteria to divid into two in the bodi as compar to other diseas caus bacteria which can doubl in minut say sunkara
for comparison in optim condit the common gut bacteria escherichia coli some strain of which caus case of food poison can divid onc everi 20 minutesth long incub time is problemat not just for the patient but also those around them
dure thi time a patient who doesn't know that they'v been infect can pass on the infect to other particularli to close contact such as famili membersonc a leprosi infect ha becom establish and develop into the multibacillari form it can take up to two year to treat even with a combin of antibiot
anoth issu is antibiot resist
the origin treatment for leprosi wa the antibiot dapson which wa discov to be effect against the bacteria in the 1940 – befor then it wa incur
howev by the 1960 thi drug wa becom less effect
today there are sever more effect option particularli the antibiot rifampicin
the modern approach of use sever antibiot togeth wa partli design to prevent resist develop again but thi remain an ongo concern
on the other hand with earli diagnosi and treatment leprosi is an order of magnitud easier to elimin
unfortun diagnos leprosi is extrem difficult
at the moment the standard method is to take a biopsi
with thi techniqu a tini incis is made on a skin lesion through which blood is squeez out and tissu fluid and pulp are collect for test under the microscop
but thi method is labori and expens requir a laboratori and technic expertis
thi is particularli challeng in rural area where laboratori facil are not alway avail as well as in lowincom countri where leprosi is preval and resourc are scarc
as a result mani patient are diagnos late in the cours of the diseas when nerv and skin damag ha alreadi occur say sunkaraleprosi is much easier to cure if it' treat earli credit alamyth issu is compound by the fact that scientist still don't know exactli how leprosi spread
it' surprisingli difficult to catch and often requir mani month of close contact with an infect person
the current consensu is that it is like to be transmit via droplet in the air when someon cough or sneez but there may be other rout such as through the skinrec scientist also found the bacteria in red squirrel live the uk but despit extens effort no other anim carrier have yet been found
there have even been suggest that red squirrel could have been respons for spread the diseas in mediev europ
other possibl natur reservoir for the bacteria may exist and it ha even been found to surviv in soil accord to sampl analys from the uk bangladesh and india
howev as with armadillo it' unclear how these wild pool of leprosi might be affect it transmiss in human
so rather than go through the labori diagnost process one option is to blankettreat peopl who may have been expos
in order to prevent the spread of leprosi in 2018 the who introduc a signific intervent – close contact of leprosi patient were track down and given a singl dose of rifampicin say pemmaraju
it wa found to have a protect effect of around 5560
howev becaus the pandem disrupt diagnosi lead to a miss 140000 case worldwid thi would have an impact on leprosy' spread
assum each leprosi patient ha 10 contact that' over a 15 million peopl who are at risk of develop leprosi becaus they haven't been abl to take a singl dose of rifampicin say smithrifampicin treatment ha had a signific impact in countri like ghana say benedict quao who lead the nation leprosi control programm in ghana which is a member of the global partnership for zero leprosi
for the first time ever countri had medic guidelin that could push polit leadership to act he say
though the covid19 pandem is larg respons for disrupt to thi new programm it did introduc one use new tool contact trace
the method ha been help in track down the contact of leprosi patient in mani area so that they can receiv a dose of the prevent antibiot
the snag is that some countri may not be abl to mobilis enough resourc for the regular deliveri of rifampicin to contact of leprosi patient say quao
in ghana we'v had that experi in six of our 16 region and we want to ramp it up
it is a good time for us to have thi intervent but it' not a perfect intervent
countri recognis that
it difficult to diagnos leprosi quickli partli becaus the bacteria grow so slowli credit alamyif an effect rapid diagnost test were avail – one that wa noninvas and effect mani of these miss case of leprosi and close contact of patient could be diagos without the need for blanket prescript of rifampicin to potenti healthi individu
the good news is that these diagnost test are current under develop – though they may not be avail for some time
to studi the diseas and it progress and develop diagnost test scientist often need to inject m lepra into armadillo a techniqu that wa first attempt in 1971
the fact that we cannot cultur grow thi bacteria so easili in laboratori set is anoth factor hinder the progress of develop these test say sunkara
new horizonssinc 2000 novarti foundat ha partner with the who suppli drug free of cost global for multidrug therapi
in februari 2022 they partner with fiocruz for a studi that use artifici intellig ai to acceler leprosi diagnosi
i call it appli stateoftheart technolog to an ancient diseas say sunkara
there are at least 2030 other skin diseas that present as white patch on the skin say sunkara
use the ai algorithm to analys the way light reflect differ off the surfac of each skin diseas it' possibl to identifi leprosi case distinguish them from other similar condit with far more accuraci
their studi publish in lancet region health peg the accuraci at 90 – but with 1229 skin imag the data set remain small at the moment
if it succe on a larger scale it might one day be a use tool to help speed up diagnosi and treatment
continu stigmawhil modern advanc in the treatment and diagnosi of leprosi have been lifechang for mani patient there' one problem that ha never quit gone away relentless discrimin
leprosi remain a deeproot human right issu say alic cruz the un special rapporteur on the elimin of discrimin against person affect by leprosi a role she' held sinc novemb 2017
there are more than a hundr law that discrimin against peopl with leprosi worldwid creat a strong stigma that can act as a barrier for get treatment she say
in some countri leprosi is ground for divorc
in india thi wa the case until law were amend in 2019
mani peopl affect by the diseas still struggl to get job and the diseas can hinder their access to healthcar and educ
countri should do everyth in their power to have discriminatori law abolish and to put in place polici that can guarante econom and social right to peopl affect by leprosi say cruz
go forward we should ask ourselv the question are our healthcar system work to afford full access to person affect by leprosi
thi is becaus leprosi is much more than a diseas it becam a label that dehumanis peopl who are affect by it
thi articl wa updat on 25 januari 2023 to correct an error that state nineband armadillo were endem to southern and central unit state and nativ to india and indonesia

future,"anzèr is often hail as europe' greenest ski resort
but the swiss villag had a difficult start to it 2023 winter season
like mani other alpin ski resort lowli anzèr wa forc to close some of it pist due to lack of snowfal and raini condit in late decemb and the first few day of januaryth alp experienc record high temperatur over christma and new year reach 209c 70f in northwest switzerland
it wa except warm over christma and new year say stephani dijkman director of anzèr tourism
nearli all the snow in the villag wa gone
i wa quit worri
peopl were unabl to ski down to the villag she addsfortun it start snow again in earli januari just in time for the arriv of the real ski fan who book their trip outsid of the holiday season and are hope for veri good condit she saysbut the recent warm weather and winter washout throughout the alp is an omen of what await the ski industri
mani resort are awar that they onli have two option close or adapt their busi model to cope with mount climat threatsfrom the swiss alp to the rocki mountain resort are grappl with the impact of climat chang by tri to provid suffici snow cover and rapidli adapt to the chang condit while envisag what their futur look like in a warm worldbesid measur to reduc it own emiss such as by invest in renew energi and build europe' largest woodfir heat plant anzèr is plan ahead for a time where ski may no longer be viabl
we'r awar that we need to adapt the resort for the year to come say dijkman
we'r invest more in bike trail in climb rout and walk path and highlight all that we have to offer whether it' in the summer or winter
climat chang is turn ski into an endang pastim
ski season are becom shorter and slope are turn green as temperatur rise
heavi rainfal in alpin resort contribut to snow melt and slushi conditionswhen temperatur rise the atmospher end up hold more water vapour which lead to more rainfal say mari cavitt a glaciologist and climat research at the cathol univers of louvain in belgium
when temperatur increas water vapour fall as rain instead of fall as snow she add
that is what is happen at low altitud ski station which are below 1600m 5250ft
there we are see a lot more rain on snow event which increas the melt of exist snow
at low altitud resort in europ snow depth is shrink by 34cm 1216in everi 10 year say cavitteski season are becom shorter and slope are turn green as temperatur rise credit dietmar stiplovsek getti imagesanoth major concern is the rapid disappear of glacier
alpin resort such as tign in franc reli on glacier for snow cover and water suppli
in the european alp glacier are expect to vanish almost complet by 2100 with the un intergovernment panel on climat chang warn that they could lose 94 of their 2017 volum by the end of the centuri
as temperatur rise glacial ice melt faster and there is less fresh snow
glacier melt could lead to sever flood and eros in the valley below and increas the risk of avalanch destroy critic infrastructur as well as significantli reduc water suppli for local mountain communitiesaccord to a 2017 studi by the institut for snow and avalanch research the alp could lose up to 70 of their snow cover by 2100 if global temperatur rise in line with businessasusu
the world is current on track for an averag of 27c 49f of warm by 2100
if global temperatur rise is kept below 2c 36f though the reduct in snow cover will be limit to 30 accord to the studyris temperatur and decreas snowfal are shorten the winter ski season a concern trend for the mountain commun whose livelihood depend on the winter sport industryin a swath of us ski resort cover a combin area the size of virginia the ski season shrank by an averag of 34 day between 1982 and 2016 accord to a 2018 studyanzère' winter season ha shrunk by just a few day over the past 30 year say dijkman
but in some european resort the season ha shorten by week and that is obvious go to have quit a big impact
a lack of snow isn't the onli challeng that ski resort are contend with
in the unit state wildfir are almost a greater threat say auden schendler senior vice presid of sustain at aspen ski compani which oper the aspen snowmass resort in coloradoov the past five year wildfir have come danger close to town and shut down major highway in the ski region
we'r alreadi see fire at ski resort
they'r as big a threat as loss of snow say schendler ad that in recent year the resort ha also experienc mudslid caus by extrem rainfallth emiss from travel it took to report thi stori were 0kg co2
the digit emiss from thi stori are an estim 12g to 36g co2 per page view
find out more about how we calcul thi figur hereski resort are scrambl to ensur that they can stay open for their entir season and provid tourist with the snowcov picturesqu set they expectto do thi they are har huge snowmak machin which cover the pist in fresh white powdera studi by the univers of basel in switzerland warn that resort situat below 18002000m 59006600ft will increasingli have to reli on artifici snow to keep just their higher ski slope open for up to 100 consecut day while their lower slope may not be possibl to save
thi would rais their water consumpt by 79 by 2100
dure an averag winter toward the end of the centuri a resort would consum about 540 million litr 119 million gallon of water compar to today' 300 million litr 66 million gallon
in the french alp water consumpt could increas ninefold by 2100 accord to the studythi could lead to conflict between the ski industri and local commun who may reli on the water for hydropow the research warn
read about how small hydropow plant have long sustain remot commun in the alpsth studi also predict a huge rise in oper cost for ski resort if they are forc to use artifici snowmak to maintain their slope
thi is becaus the cannon that distribut the snow and the plough that groom the pist are incred energyintens and run on pollut fossil fuel
there are current no snowmak machin that run on renew and plan to reduc overal emiss are focus around improv efficiencysolut to adapt to the chang climat in the mountain therefor iron add more co2 to the atmospher and are make the climat problem wors say cavitteeven today snow plough on averag account for roughli 60 of a resort' carbon emiss while snow cannon contribut about 25 say cavitt
ski lift aren't as pollut she say sinc mani resort are tri to use renew electricitybesid the climat impact of snow machin there is also an oper challeng as artifici snow can onli be produc when temperatur stay below 1c 34f
the air ha to be cold enough that the water droplet which the machin expel freez and turn into snow particlesov christma and new year mani alpin resort were forc to close their slope as the temperatur were too high to gener artifici snowski resort are invest in mountain bike trail walk path and climb rout to encourag tourist to visit in the summer credit alamymeanwhil some have resort to cover glacier in protect blanket to stop them from melt in the summer
made out of white uvresist synthet materi the blanket shield the thick winter snow from the sun' ray dure the warmer summer month
accord to a 2021 studi the techniqu can reduc the melt of snow and ice by 5070 compar to unprotect surfacesbut it is a costli process the study' author warn
cover all of switzerland' 1000 largest glacier would cost about 14bn swiss franc 15bn £12bn annual they estimatether are also neg environment consequ associ with thi adapt measur warn cavitt
pollut machin are use to put the blanket down and remov them
and when they take them off there' alway piec of plastic that are left behind which contamin the glacier and surround land she say
there are also concern about how thi measur will impact local biodivers and wildlif she add
these shortterm measur will not shield the industri from the loom climat threat
the ski industri is not go to be abl to save itself acknowledg schendlerdespit thi bleak outlook mani resort have adopt ambiti longterm sustain goal in a bid to reduc their emiss and protect their natur resourcesbig sky resort which sit at an elev of 2200m 7200ft in the rocki mountain in southern montana is aim for net zero emiss by 2030 under it forev project which wa launch in 2021

ski resort use fossil fuel and a lot of energi
it would be complet hypocrit if those resort were not work to fix the system say schendlermeanwhil a wood pellet plant heat 600 apart two hotel and a public swim pool in anzèr save the villag 15 million litr 330000 gallon of oil a year
most of the resort alreadi run on hydroelectr which is gener at the nearbi tseuzier damanzèr is also carfre and offer free public transport to all visitor in a bid to encourag peopl to travel more sustain
tourist also have a role to play in help reduc emiss and preserv the mountain say dijkman
it' a mindset that need to not onli be present among local busi but also among the peopl that come here on holiday
thi start with choos how they travel to the ski resort
accord to a recent survey by the ski club of great britain just 2 of british travel take the train to go ski compar to 72 who fli
read more about the climat impact of fli
for peopl in europ look to travel in a more sustain way to the alp there are plenti of option rang from the alpen express an overnight train travel from the netherland via cologn to austrian resort or the travelski express which run between london and the french alp via a eurostar to pariseven if they are unabl to chang their own fate resort can still play an import role in the fight against climat chang say schendler
the role of the industri is to help the public understand what they stand to lose from climat chang and to advoc for solut
ski resort are the perfect messeng for highlight the realiti of the climat crisi say schendler
peopl love what ski offer them today
the threat of that disappear is the kind of viscer hit that peopl need to catapult themselv into action
font agre that the ski industri can make signific behaviour changes…w can realli help mitig the impact of climat chang she say
i'd like to think that we'r go to live in a world where ski will still be around
but thi look like an unlik realiti for mani resort especi lowerli one in europ
mani are seek to pivot their busi model and ensur that they have a futur if there is no more snowsom ski resort are cover glacier in protect blanket to stop them from melt in the summer credit miguel medina getti imageswe'r now invest more in summer activ than we'r invest in winter one say dijkman
the plan is to highlight all the activ that the mountain have to offer without turn the resort into a disney theme park she saysschendl say a futur without ski will be veri difficult for resort
even with increas invest they will struggl to gener a similar stream of revenu dure the summer he argu
ski is a huge busi he say
the econom throughput in the summer is go to be much lower
you can't realli build a busi around hike
but accord to rachael carver who survey ski tourist at the austrian resort stubai glacier for her dissert at the univers of staffordshir in the uk peopl see the valu of visit the mountain even if there is no snowsom 70 of those survey said they would return to the resort if the glacier vanish cite the beauti mountain sceneri and hike opportun as the main reasonscarv also observ an increas in lastchanc tourism at stubai glacier with peopl visit the resort befor the glacier vanish complet
mani peopl are awar that glacier are melt and that ski resort are disappear
they want to see these site befor they vanish complet she saysthi increas interest in visit glacier provid resort with an opportun to educ peopl about climat chang she note
but thi surg in lastchanc tourism is also unsustain and place even more pressur on an alreadi fragil ecosystem say carveradapt the busi model and pivot to new mountain activ is the onli choic say dijkman
we have to becom greener if we want to keep live here she sayssh is hope that tourist will continu visit the mountain even if there is no snow

future,"your gut is a bustl and thrive alien coloni
they number in their trillion and includ thousand of differ speci
mani of these microorgan includ bacteria archaea and eukarya were here long befor human have evolv alongsid us and now outnumb our own cell mani time over
inde as john cryan a professor of anatomi and neurosci at univers colleg cork rather strikingli put it in a tedx talk when you go to the bathroom and shed some of these microb just think you are becom more human
collect these microbi legion are known as the microbiota – and they play a wellestablish role in maintain our physic health from digest and metabol to immun
they also produc vital compound the human bodi is incap of manufactur on it ownbut what if they also had a hotlin to our mind
in our new book are you think clearli
29 reason you aren't and what to do about it we explor the dozen of intern and extern factor that affect and manipul the way we think from genet person and bia to technolog advertis and languag
and it turn out the microb that call our bodi their home can have a surpris amount of control over our brain
over the last few decad research have start to uncov curiou compel – and sometim controversi – evid to suggest that the gut microbiota doesn't just help to keep our brain in prime work order by help to free up nutrient for it from our food but may also help to shape our veri thought and behaviour
their find may even potenti bolster how we understand and lead to new treatment for a rang of mental health condit from depress and anxieti to schizophreniath pictur is still veri far from complet but in the wake of the covid19 pandem which ha had a deleteri impact on people' mental health in mani part of the world unpick thi puzzl could be more import than everour gut are a menageri of differ speci of bacteria some of which appear to commun with our brain credit rodolfo parulan jrgetti imageson of the research field' key origin stori took place in the north american wilder – and be warn it make for some stomachchurn read
the year wa 1822 and a young trader name alexi st martin wa loiter outsid a trade post on what is now call mackinac island in what is now michigan when a musket accident went off next to him fire a shot into hi side from less than a yard 91cm away
hi injuri were so bad that part of hi lung part of hi stomach and a good portion of hi breakfast that day spill out through the wound in hi left side
death seem certain but an armi surgeon name william beaumont rode to the rescu and save st martin' life although it took the best part of a year and multipl round of surgerywhat beaumont couldn't repair howev wa the hole in hi patient' stomach
thi persist fistula would remain a grim and last legaci of the accid but beaumont wasn't one to pass up a good opportun – howev unpleas
realis that the hole provid a uniqu window into the human gut he spent year investig the intricaci of st martin' digest
exactli how will a volunt st martin wa is open to debat as beaumont employ him as a servant while conduct research on him – the murki arrang almost certainli wouldn't be consid ethic today
among the find beaumont uncov dure hi studi of st martin' gut howev includ how they were affect by it owner' emot such as angerthrough thi find beaumont who would go on to be laud as the father of gastric physiolog had hit upon the idea of a gutbrain axi – that the gut and the brain aren't entir independ of one anoth but instead interact with one influenc the other and vice versa
and now we know that the microorgan within our gut make thi process even more complex and remark
more and more research is reveal that the gut microbiom can influenc the brain and behaviour across a varieti of differ anim say elain hsiao associ professor in integr biolog and physiolog at the univers of california lo angel ucla
how exactli our microbiota might be influenc our mind is a grow pioneer and still rel novel field
but there have been advanc over the last 20 year or so particularli in anim
and slowli a case is be built to suggest that these microorgan aren't just a vital part of our physic selv but also our mental and emot selv too
in medicin we tend to compartmentalis the bodi say cryan
so when we talk about issu with the brain we tend to think about the neck upward
but we need to frame thing evolutionarili
it' import to rememb that the microb were here befor human exist so we have evolv with these 'friend with benefits'
there ha never been a time when the brain exist without the signal come from the microb
what if these signal are actual realli import in determin how we feel how we behav and how we act
and could we modul these microb therapeut to improv think behaviour and brain health
you might also like to readhsiao is one of the research lead the way in thi field and her lab at ucla ha explor the part these microorgan might play in everyth from foetal brain develop to cognit and neurolog condit such as epilepsi and depress
she ha also investig how these microb might be influenc our brain and think
specif gut microb can modul the immun system in way that impact the brain and also produc molecul that signal directli to neuron to regul their activ she say
we find that gut microb can regul the earli develop of neuron in way that lead to last impact on brain circuit and behaviour
we also find that under shorter timescal gut microb can regul the product of biochem like serotonin that activ stimul neuron activ
inde research suggest our microb may be commun with our brain through numer pathway from immun to biochem
anoth candid is the vagu nerv which act as the superfast internet connect between our brain and intern organ includ the gut
the bacteria lactobacillu rhamnosu jb1 for exampl appear to improv the mood of anxiou and depress mice
thi benefici effect is remov howev when the signal travel along the vagu nerv are block suggest it could be be use as a commun pathway by the bacteriawilliam beaumont' research on the digest juic of alexi st martin gave some of the first hint of the interact between our gut and brain credit getti imagesmuch of the research in thi field is conduct in mice and other small anim
and mice of cours aren't human
but given the mindboggl complex of establish causal between microbi signal and chang in human thought and behaviour anim studi have provid some intrigu insight into the strang interact between bacteria and brain
research for exampl show that germfre rat and mice those without ani microbiota after be rear in steril condit are more prone to anxious and less sociabl than those with an intact microbiota
germfre mice and those given antibiot have also been found to be more hyperact prone to riski behaviour and less abl to learn or rememb
antibiot which can reduc the microbiota in an anim also reduc shoal behaviour in zebrafish while probiot boost itagain the human brain is vastli more complex than that of a rodent or fish but they do share some similar and can offer clue
it make sens that bacteria wherev they live might benefit from help their host to be more sociabl and less anxiou
by interact with other peopl for exampl we help our bacteria spread
and whether or not they'r realli pull our string it' in our microbes' evolutionari interest to make their environ as conduc to surviv as possiblebut do commun microb congreg zebrafish or friendli mice realli matter
hope ye say the research
ultim a better understand of these process could lead us toward groundbreak new treatment for a rang of mental health condit
we'v coin the term 'psychobiotics' for microbiotabas intervent that have a benefici effect on the human brain say cryan
and there are more and more of these psychobiot approach come
there are caveat of cours
while some strain of bacteria appear to have a posit effect on the human mind mani other don't and research have yet definit to establish whi – and how
human are also unfathom complex and when it come to think and mental health there are countless other factor at play from genet and person to the environ around us
we need mani more largescal human studi to take into account these individu differ say cryan
and mayb not everyon will respond to a singl bacteria in the same way becaus everyon will have a slightli differ baselin microbiota anyway
disclaim asid howev more research could bring fresh hope
the good news is that you can chang your microbiota while there' not a whole lot you can do to chang your genet – except blame your parent and your grandpar cryan add
the fact that you can modifi your microbiota potenti give you agenc over your own health outcom
inde pro and prebiot supplement simpl dietari chang such as eat more ferment food and fibr – and even perhap medit – can help alter our microbiota in way that benefit our mindsphilip burnet an associ professor in the univers of oxford' depart of psychiatri note that mani mental health condit have been associ with chang in the microbiota
often thi imbal or dysbiosi is characteris by a reduc amount of certain bacteria particularli those that produc shortchain fatti acid such as butyr which is wide believ to improv brain function when they break down fibr in the gutinde a 2019 studi by mireia vallescolom a microbiologist at ku leuven univers of leuven in belgium at the time and her colleagu found a correl between the amount of these butyrateproduc bacteria and wellb
specif the research note in the studi that butyrateproduc faecalibacterium and coprococcu bacteria were consist associ with higher qualiti of life indic
togeth with dialist coprococcu spp
were also deplet in depress even after correct for the confound effect of antidepress
antibiot can chang the shoal behaviour of zebrafish credit getti imageshuman studi on the commun between the gut the brain and the microbiota are still rel few and far between
and burnet urg caution it is not known whether these alter level in gut bacteria caus low mood or whether microbi number chang becaus peopl who are depress might modifi their eat habit or eat less
nevertheless he ha been explor how prebiot which encourag bacteria to grow and probiot live bacteria might one day be use as psychobiot to nurtur popul of good bacteria – and treat a varieti of mental health conditionsfor exampl one 2019 studi by burnet rita baião a psychologist also at the univers of oxford and their colleagu uncov some particularli interest find
although the studi wa fund by a compani that manufactur probiot bacteria it use a randomis doubleblind placebocontrol trial – consid to be a gold standard studi design dure which neither particip nor research are awar whether they are receiv the treatment or not
the research investig the effect a multispeci probiot might have on emot process and cognit in peopl with mild to moder depress
but the studi also monitor their mood befor and after the experi use the patient health questionnaire9 phq9 which measur depress severityth particip who weren't take ani other medic were either given a placebo or a commerci avail probiot – which contain 14 speci of bacteria includ bacillu subtili bifidobacterium bifidum bifidobacterium breve and bifidobacterium infanti for four weeksth result were fascin not least that the particip on the probiot experienc a signific subject improv in mood compar with the group on placebo essenti becom less depress accord to the phq9
chang in the participants' level of anxieti which were also measur were not observedthi wa a small 71 particip brief studi and more research is need to prove causal
but it' an earli indic that psychobiot may one day be a help treatment for those with depress – particularli those who are reluct to seek medic help or take tradit antidepress say burnet
inde psychobiot won't replac exist medic – but may eventu provid a help adjunct
they won't make everyon happier say burnet but probiot could one day complement more establish mental health treatment
onli time will tell whether we will have psychobiot he add
but the field is realli move forward
thi area of research is domin by anim studi howev so we do need more human studi use larger number of particip
but the potenti of psychobiot ha captur imagin
we also attract a lot of interest from the public add burnet
peopl are extrem interest in maintain their health and wellb with natur supplement and encourag the growth of good bacteria to support mental health ha captur the imagin of the gener public
especi now when peopl are more anxiou and depress as a result of the pandem
with ami chiach kao and other burnet ha also explor the role these microorgan might play in psychosi – and whether prebiot which help to promot the growth of bacteria in the gut might help peopl with the condit think more clearli
mani peopl are awar that psychosi can caus hallucin delus and a detach from realiti
but peopl with psychosi also often encount difficulti with cognit function such as attent memori and problemsolv which can impact their abil to hold down job and relationship
while medic can be use to treat the hallucin and delus improv sufferers' cognit impair ha prove more difficult
a doubleblind placebocontrol crossov studi by burnet and chiach kao howev suggest a possibl way forward
we found that give a prebiot to peopl with psychosi did improv cognit function accord to the clinic scale say burnetat the start of the studi the particip were on medic and free of psychot symptom – but were still experienc the cognit impair typic of psychosi
over 12 week they were given a prebiot or a placebo while their metabol immun and level of cognit impair wa measur over time
at the end of the 12 week they were then switch so both group had an equal amount of time on the prebiot and the placeboand the effect wa small but signific
the prebiot improv overal cognit function particularli attent and problem solv lead the research to conclud that the improv wa suffici to boost social and mental wellb
there wa no evid of the participants' immun or metabol chang so it wasn't clear how the prebiot may have trigger thi effect
but it' anoth small step toward understand the relationship between our microbiota and our mental health and the potenti develop of new treatment for disord that affect our thinkingther are hint that the gut microbiota may affect cognit skill more broadli too
it is well known that antibiot disrupt the gut microbiota but do they affect our cognit
one recent studi which monitor the health and wellb of 14542 femal nurs for sever year while they work for the nh in the uk found that those who had use antibiot for long period of time more than two month score lower on cognit test such as learn work memori and attent task than those who hadn't taken such medic
importantli the cognit of the women who had taken antibiot wa slightli poorer when they were follow up seven year later
although thi is onli a correl the research think it could be due to antibioticsinduc chang in the gutour gut microb may even play a role in how sociabl we are if research in rodent are to be believ – and we pick up microb through contact with other credit getti imagesthere' still a veri long way to go though to understand thi properli
thi is a fascin but highli complex field and research requir fund
the reward howev could be profound
there are onli a hand of specif microb that have been studi so far say hsiao
not necessarili becaus they are the most signific but becaus we as scientist have much more to do to realli understand the enorm divers of microb in the gut and how they function individu and as commun
i'm most excit about the opportun to uncov new mechanist understand of how we and our microbi symbiont can work togeth to promot health and thwart diseas
in the meantim perhap we should all pay a bit more attent to our microbiota
a mediterranean diet that' high in fibr particularli from veget is like a good place to start
and ferment food such as kimchi and kefir a ferment milk drink may also be benefici
in a small studi with 45 particip for exampl cryan and colleagu show that those who were put on a diet that includ a lot of fibr prebiot and ferment food such as onion yoghurt kefir and sauerkraut report feel less stress than a control group which wa on a differ diet
what i like about ferment food is that they democratis the scienc say cryan
they don't realli cost much and you don't have to get them from some fanci store
you can do it yourself
in thi field we want to provid mental health solut to peopl from all socioeconom area
the relationship we have with our microbiota is a bit like a feder add cryan
these microb are our fellow travel
we'd do well to rememb that – for the sake of both our physic and quit possibl mental health

future,"scroll through parent feed on social media and you'll soon come across socal mileston card pastelcolour card mark a baby' first attempt at crawl sit up or walk along with their age
it' not just on social media that development mileston have becom someth to celebr – or stress over
one recent poll for exampl found that around six in 10 us parent worri about their babi meet their development mileston
but few knew what should happen whenoth parent may take the opposit approach and pay littl attent to the time of new skill trust that a child will develop at their own pacewhich rais the question what is the point of mileston – and how should parent use them
are they a crucial tool that can help us spot earli on when someth is off track
or are they just anoth way for parent to oneup each otherth answer depend partli on what exactli we mean by mileston
for a start the reason that healthcar profession give for their import can differ from parents' view
on a veri concret level a mileston is a descript of a behaviour of a child that parent either say their child can do or cannot do say chri sheldrick a research associ professor at boston univers who focus on paediatr screen protocolsh point to the liter mean of the word itself
if you'r in a 10k race at the 5k point there might be a marker a mileston
by definit at the start of the race noon ha pass it
by the end of the race everyon hascheck an individu baby' progress along those marker can help healthcar profession assess their develop
but sinc parent know their child best it can be a good idea for them to know roughli when babi tend to do thing for the first time expert say though there are import caveat to the idea of typic develop to which we'll get laterwhen parent take a veri relax view of mileston – assum that their child hasn't yet tri crawl or walk simpli becaus they have a more laidback person for exampl – they may be miss other explan healthcar profession saymileston can be a tool for spot underli problem and offer the right support earli on credit getti imagesthi articl is part of famili tree a seri that explor the issu and opportun famili around the world face today – and how they'll shape tomorrow
you might also likether are absolut kid whose person impact what they'r will to do
so they might be the one that are trend toward that later side say kaitlin rickerd a paediatr physic therapist in new york
but when it start to fall outsid of the rang of where it can be expect there' usual someth that need to be address
there' a reason no matter how big or small it might be
development delay are common experienc by one in six children in the us
a delay alon doesn't signifi a medic condit – one review of 404 18monthold who weren't walk independ found that twothird had no underli patholog for examplewhen there is an issu though interven as young as possibl is key
delay speech for exampl can be a signifi of autism while late walk can be a sign of cerebr palsi
spot such differ earli can help parent understand and support their child' uniqu develop
we know that in the first three year of life the amount of brain growth the amount of learn the amount of mileston that a child is acquir is huge – which also mean it' our best window to get in there and make a differ say rickerdbut mileston are more than a tool for spot underli issu she say
after work in paediatr with older children she realis a failur to master one skill might have caus a cascad effect
take struggl to hold a pencil to write it could relat to weak in the arch of a child' hand which could have been impact by not weightbear as a babi whether through crawl or tummi time she saysthi profession view of mileston primarili as a screen tool differ from how some parent treat mileston in everyday life as a predict sometim competit indic of abil or talentinde there is some evid that hit certain mileston earli can be indic of a higher intellig or attain more educ later
but say sheldrick thi is true across whole popul not specif children
if there wa a oneinamillion chanc of be a profession soccer player for a typic develop child for an earli walker it might be one in 900000 he sayswhich mileston are mark and celebr may vari huge between cultur and even individu famili credit getti imagesand push children to achiev mileston can backfir
there is some evid that frequent use of babi walker and jumper can imped motor develop for exampleeven the metaphor of the race with each mile mark by a stone doesn't quit fit the complex realiti of human develop sheldrick point out
if you'r watch a race you know which runner are exactli 1k behind the 5k mileston
you can estim when they'll hit it
onc they do you know the exact moment it happen
and everi runner who finish the race will reach it at some pointdevelopment mileston don't offer thi clariti
nor are they a univers concept
their interpret and definit may vari consider between cultur – and even individu famili
a good exampl is 'can your child walk
' sheldrick say
what do you mean by 'walk'
can your child walk a mile
can they walk all the way to the well and back
have they taken a few step
thi confus is whi new screen tool like the updat mileston recent put out by the us center for diseas control and prevent cdc and american academi of pediatr aap tri to use more specif wordingmak it more complic is that children develop veri quickli
a child that isn't walk at 18 month might be run by 19
but if the child is onli test at 18 month they might be identifi as not be on trackthen there' the issu of measur
how do you decid when someth should happen
and what data is that base onth recent chang to the cdc and aap' mileston list highlight mani of these issu
for nearli 20 year like mani other offici mileston list they base mileston on the 50th percentil – if 50 of children could do someth by a certain age that wa the age for that milestonethi meant that the other 50 of caregiv might worri unnecessarili
it also encourag paediatrician to take a wait and see approach for children who hadn't hit a mileston which sometim backfir
parent of children with disabl report delay in identif becaus they were told to wait that children develop differ and that some take longer than other research involv in the chang wrotea a result in earli 2022 the cdc move it benchmark to the 75th percentil
but the risk now run the other way with the age set later famili might notic a child' delay later toothen there' the question of where these expect come froma boy in chiapa mexico stack firewood – which in some famili is an import mileston credit getti imagescultur differenceshistor there' been rel littl data on larg popul of children and mileston
in the 20th centuri psychologist arnold gesel pioneer quantifi motor mileston by observ babi from white middleclass famili from new haven connecticut and describ their behaviour movement and express over time
sinc then much of the evid on mileston ha been base on western populationsbut earli develop can look veri differ in other culturesin tajikistan for exampl it' common to swaddl babi as old as two and leav them in a cradl even awak
tajik children do acquir motor skill later than their western counterpart
but they seem to show no longterm ill effect
on the other hand in the efe tribe of the democrat republ of congo babi as young as 11 month use machet to cut fruit
suffic it to say that' not on the cdc list – nor do we worri whether us babi can do thisparent expect vari too
one older studi from 1997 found for exampl that while europeanamerican parent thought children should feed themselv by 137 month puerto rican parent did at 19 month
staff at unicef recent experienc these cultur complex firsthand
one of the un' sustain develop goal is that all children should be development on track
as a result unicef had to develop an instrument that everi countri could useth question say unicef senior advis claudia cappa wa can we come up with someth that is the equival of growth standard
can we come up with a 'typical' child
the effort which sprawl across than 200 nation statist offic paediatrician and child develop expert took five year
one of the biggest challeng wa how to make the question univers
in rural mexico for exampl unicef staff found they might get a blank look if they ask if a child could stack block
they had more luck when they ask if a child could stack firewoodin one studi highlight the need for a crosscultur perspect the research are critic of the convent view of mileston
motor mileston are millston to a 'wholechild' approach to develop they write
motor mileston are onli a perceiv version of what is an import skill they are cultur convent not univers
today child develop expert are often awar of these limit – and they are tri to correct them
the cdc' updat list for exampl use sourc like a studi of nearli 5000 children in argentina india south africa and turkey
still the question remain how much data and how mani cultur need to be repres for a list of mileston to truli be univers
and is that even possiblefor parent it might be worth rememb that mileston are meant to be help – not anxietyinduc
mileston are import
they'r worth pay attent to sheldrick say
if there' someth that concern you i would follow up on it

in her role as director of the paediatr infecti diseas divis at maimonid children' hospit in new york she had seen thi befor
an outbreak of respiratori syncyti viru rsv – a winter viru that can feel like a common cold in adult but which can be danger for some young childrenther wa a wave last autumn – and an unexpect one in spring thi year
now in the earli autumn month of 2022 it wa back again
we'v had to doubl the capac of our icu she say refer to the intens care unit reserv for the sickest patient
some of the children there have been put on mechan ventil to help them breathersv typic hit the youngest children hardest but the patient agha and her colleagu have treat late tend to be approach school age around three or four year old
in thi age group rsv would usual appear as a coldlik ill with a runni nose and cough
but now some of them were strugglingrsv strep a the flu and other ill and infect are resurg among children after have been mostli suppress dure the covid19 lockdown
here' what doctor and health author say parent can do to keep children safe and healthi in the winterth nh and other health author recommend wash your hand with soap for 20 second to help stop the spread of virus and bacteria includ strep a and rsv
they also recommend be care not to share potenti contamin cup towel or other itemspar are advis to use tissu to help their children catch cough or sneez then discard the use tissu as soon as possibl and wash their hand with soap and warm water to stop the spreadmak sure your children' vaccin are up to date can also protect them from a wide rang of diseas – includ the flu and mani highli contagi and potenti danger diseas such as measl and polioth step of give prevent antibiot for exampl to protect children in the midst of a strep a outbreak at their school or nurseri need to be care consid doctor say to avoid encourag antibiot resist
superbug creat by antibiot overus have pose a particular threat to newborn highlight the need to use antibiot with caution
plu antibiot have no effect on virus such as rsv
everyon is concern obvious becaus older children toler thi viru quit well – whi were they not
she sayswhen covid19 rampag across the world mani countri introduc strict lockdown to thwart transmiss of the viru
children were kept out of school and nurseri for week or month on end
now that they are mix again doctor have notic period surg in other diseas includ rsv flu and ill caus by group a streptococcu a bacteria also known as strep asixteen children have die in the uk sinc septemb follow strep a infect
accord to the uk' health secur agenc ukhsa dure 201718 the last high season for strep a in the countri a total of 27 death in under 18 were record
howev the 202223 season is not yet overepidemiologist continu to investig whether covid19 lockdown increas the likelihood of surg in other diseas given that respiratori infect were more or less stop in their track dure the first year or so of the pandem
there is also the possibl that catch covid19 ha increas children' suscept to other diseas by harm their immun system somehow – though doctor say thi is unlik as there is no evid for such an effect
but what exactli is go onfor week now on routin confer call with fellow doctor around the countri ronni cheung a consult paediatrician in london ha heard report of strep a infect and respiratori virus caus problem for children
it' been notabl he saysyou may also be interest inalthough strep a for exampl is not usual lifethreaten – it might simpli caus a sore throat or tonsil – in rare case it can caus invas potenti deadli infect includ meningitischeung stress that the recent death in the uk associ with strep a are extrem unusu it doesn't make them ani less tragic but it is realli import to bear that in mind
there' a pretti good argument behind the idea that infect like thi are spike as a kind of delay impact of the covid19 lockdown he suggest
but it is difficult to unpick that from natur season variabilitywhat the data clearli show is that dure 2020 and into 2021 the spread of respiratori virus plummet explain connor bamford a virologist at queen' univers belfast
we saw a real reduct in virus mostli rsv and influenza he saysth uk depart of health and social care confirm thi trend in march 2021
and figur from australia and germani also show a flatlin of respiratori virus dure the same periodresearch then track unusu peak in the month follow
a studi in germani found that level of rsv in the countri reach a record high between septemb and octob 2021 – up to 50 time the preval record in the prepandem year of 2017 to 2019
medic research in new zealand also notic a huge spike in rsv case dure 2021nicol maison at the univers hospit munich wa lead author on the german studi
she like agha ha seen yet anoth resurg of rsv thi winter we are current see a signific increas in respiratori infect especi respiratori syncyti viru in germani
she add that she is work on a new paper about the situationbesid clinic data scientist have other way of monitor diseas transmiss
for exampl sinc 2021 bamford and colleagu have been track the preval of rsv and flu viru materi in wastewat to better understand transmiss of these pathogen in northern ireland
outbreak are clearli visibl in thi data he sayskeep up to date with vaccin is one way to limit the spread of infecti diseas such as flu as well as covid19 credit getti imageswhil our view of what' go on is get sharper mani unansw question remain includ whether covid19 infect ha actual affect children' immun system in such a way that they are less abl to fight off rsv strep a flu and other pathogen
we haven't seen ani data to support that prior covid infect decreas your immun and that you will get a more sever subsequ infect of ani other viru or even bacteria say agha
she also say she would not in gener expect to see longterm impact on children' health or immun as a result of what is happen now though those who contract sever lung diseas when veri young might experi ongo effect thereofeith way it remain import to protect children as best as possibl she add
bamford suggest appli some social distanc avoid crowd place and wear mask in some situat
improv ventil indoor could also helpfor strep a it' possibl to use prevent antibiot in order to reduc the likelihood of infect within a nurseri or school where there is a known risk
but one would want thi to be target to avoid encourag antibiot resist say clare murray at the univers of manchest
give it to a whole school is probabl over the top she explain
occasion we'll give a whole class a prophylaxi if there' been a lot of contact – it' not a new thing
both agha and cheung expect that the intermitt spike in childhood diseas that we are see postlockdown will level out
hope thing will be back more or less to normal as earli as next year agha suggestssinc the covid19 lockdown when mani children were not abl to go to school there have been surg in certain childhood ill credit getti imagesdo all of thi mean that covid19 lockdown were a bad idea and put children at risk unnecessarili
i absolut refut that say cheung note that covid19 itself wa extrem danger and caus larg number of death
lockdown be so disrupt were like alway go to affect peopl in neg way – from the econom impact to effect on mental health and appar disrupt immun to other virus

apart from a tendenc to repetit stroke soft fabric or run grain of sand through my finger i also found swirl and gentl rock mesmerisingli soothingwhen i wa eventu diagnos with autism much later in life – at the age of 60 – it gave me a new understand of how and whi i behav the way i do
that includ certain childhood behaviour from fabricstrok to the way i play with toy and insist on specif food
but it also rais question such as what might these prefer reveal about how children with autism experi the world
and how could we use thi understand to help children fulfil their potenti form friendship and enjoy lifea a scienc journalist i natur look to scientif research for answer – and there is a grow bodi of evid provid fascin new insight into behaviour that were long consid a mysteryaut spectrum disord or autism affect one in everi 100 children accord to the world health organ
a development condit caus by differ in the brain it can affect how a person absorb process and respond to inform
it is usual categoris along a spectrum from mild to sever
in the diagnost and statist manual of mental disord dsm 5 publish by the american psychiatr associ thi spectrum is divid into level 1 2 and 3 where those with level 3 autism requir veri substanti support
within those categori there is a huge divers of need and experi as well as some common traitstak the swirl and rock for exampl
these kind of rhythmic repetit action – a common featur of autism – are known as selfstimulatori behaviour or stim
they can also includ movement like hand flap foot shake and finger flick
even today i can't resist fondl cashmer or faux fur cloth in shop and will often furtiv touch the back of someone' irresist soft coat in public
i also bodi rock occasion though onli ever in privat becaus i know it make most observ uncomfortablestim can appear pointless or even disturb to other
as a result there are variou treatment aim at chang or reduc it
but as with mani behaviour associ with autism the person engag in it is not necessarili experienc what you might thinksu nelson as a child at a famili event credit sue nelsonwhil some form of stim can be harm and should be address such as a child hit their head repeatedli against a wall other are use and help
they are not outofcontrol movement but instead serv a purpos and can be a calm cope mechan
for me and mani other young and old rock reduc anxieti
it' someth that' repetit and sooth but even in the latest diagnost and statist manual of mental disord dsm 5 by the american psychiatr associ the 'psychiatr bible' these sort of behaviour are classifi as purposeless say steven kapp a development psychologist at the univers of portsmouth who wa diagnos with autism age 13
so i think a lot of research have struggl to understand whi peopl engag in these behaviour
kapp' autism help inform hi work and in recent year there ha been an increas attempt by other research to draw on autist people' view of their own experi
thi can be veri differ from the impress or judgment of those around themfor exampl outsid observ may interpret certain repetit movement includ hand flap as a distress signal
but 80 of respond to a 2015 survey of peopl with autism report that they enjoy stimmingkapp led a studi of autist adult to explor thi behaviour further
mani said they use stim in respons to sensori overload includ in confus unpredict overwhelm environ that caus them anxieti – which wa then calm by the movement
but stim wa also use simpli as a releas of ani high emot includ happi or excitementhowev the studi particip tend to suppress these sooth and enjoy movement in public
sever had stim happili as young children but hid or chang the behaviour later in adolesc when they becam awar that other judg them neg for it accord to the studi
there are plenti of autist peopl who still engag in stim say kapp
but we'r less like to do it in public becaus other often don't understand so they stigmatis it
when peopl do understand they'r more like to accept it
that' what the studi i led found
the particip report that when among accept friend and famili they stim openlysu nelson as a child with her father grandmoth and one of her brother credit sue nelsontomato soup and chocol puddingsocal repetit restrict behaviour rrb which can includ stim as well as certain routin and ritual can also affect famili dynam
while my tendenc as a child to constantli rearrang toy into categori such as size or colour rather than play with them – common among autist children – didn't affect the famili much i suspect the onlyeatingtomatosoupandchocolatepud phase wa a bit more of an issu
fortun my parent accept thi and didn't turn the dinner tabl into a battl groundin fact mani autist children are label fussi eater
one larg studi found seven out of 10 had atyp eat behaviour the most common be limit food prefer
research also show that children with autism are extrem sensit to flavour smell and textur
it' that sensori percept aspect again and for me it' relat
after that initi restrict food period dure childhood i am now addict to a varieti of highli spice food contain chilli and garlic
howev i still find it difficult to eat a chop egg sandwich without ad crisp for textur crunch and just the thought of white fish in a white sauc on mash potato make me queasyof cours mani peopl have food prefer and avers not onli those with autism
but the way such sensori experi emot aspect and emot regul interact in peopl with autism is still not fulli understood
thi includ the emot impact of sensori overload which can be veri powerfuluta frith emeritu professor of cognit develop at univers colleg london ha spent her career studi the behaviour of children with autism
in the past there wa a theori that emot were absent or disturb in autism which i think is just not true frith say
on the contrari emot are veri much in evid includ high anxieti as well as anger and aggress
thi can lead to tantrumlik meltdown often caus by sensori overloadkapp say that when someon is overstimul by light or sound mayb remov oneself from the environ or get out an accommod like wear headphon or sunglass or someth to dull some of the sensat could help
becaus a lot of autist peopl are hypersensit and will perceiv it more pain or sharpli than other he saysfriendship and connectionresearch – and especi listen to the voic of peopl with autism – ha also help overturn a number of misconcept such as the common assumpt that peopl with autism are not interest in social interact
as one studi note the assumpt that autist peopl are solitari by natur is flatli contradict by the testimoni of mani autist peopl themselv – myself includ
the desir for solitud is usual for me onli after socialis
it' a mental recharg of batteri to balanc stimul overloadcertain behaviour such as low level of eye contact may be seen as indic a lack of social interest but may actual be a sensori cope strategi the studi suggest
even research can fall into the trap of overli reli on eye contact as a measur of babies' and children' social engag some arguewhen children with autism are ask about their experi they tend to report difficulti in understand and form relationship with other children but also tend to say that they tri to initi such friendship and feel lone if there is a lack of interact
thi suggest that children with these trait may benefit from care monitor and intervent focus at improv peer relationship accord to the author of one studi
in short children with autism do enjoy and benefit from friendship but may need some help form themthi can be easier when there is a way to meet the children on their own term research suggest – for exampl by support anoth typic trait special interestssu nelson enjoy specif sensori experi as a child such as stroke soft fabric or run grain of sand through her finger credit sue nelsonwildflow button badg and spacescientist are onli begin to understand how and whi peopl with autism commonli form intens interest and the benefit thi can bring

these interest can includ certain object music comput natur and gardeninga a child mine were mathemat wildflow scienc button badg space and superhero
not much ha chang and for other like me pursu their own interest gener ha a posit effect on wellb and social contact
when children and young peopl with autism engag with their passion thi wa found to have a wide rang of benefit such as boost emot and commun skillsther will alway be activ that autist children tend to instinct dislik even someth as routin as haircut
i never enjoy have my hair wash as a child and visit a hairdress remain an uncomfort experi
while i alway ensur there will be no surpris head massag dure a shampoo i am anxiou in case they forget
for some fear or distast is induc by the sound of scissor or the feel of cut wet hair on the skin
it' import to understand that these simpl sensat which mani peopl enjoy can caus other distresswhat is often harder for parent is when their child doesn't want to engag in affection physic contact or hug due to differ in sensori process and social commun
parent tri to play some kind of simpl giveandtak game may find children with autism are not interest and parent may find thi hard
it' that turn take that reciproc a sort of copi that children with autism may struggl with say frith
the easi understand of what anoth person doe
individu enjoy of social and physic contact can vari huge
research into the effect of the covid19 lockdown on children with autism for instanc found that some children thrive while the behaviour of other worsen
the wider social environ can also play a crucial partjess live in hartlepool in the north of england

sinc then he' been expel from sever school after sensori overload led to meltdown and aggress behaviour
when the school system is complet flaw for tackl autism a few fidget toy isn't go to work say jess
what work wa when he move to a school with more space and a sensori room where kid could let rip
as a result of the increas space and understand her son' behaviour improv
the atmospher wa complet differ and that made a differ
there were teacher who believ in him and could commun with him
he could work outsid the classroom if he want as they were much more flexibl jess say

jess' son initi struggl with lockdown
eventu jess stop tri to persuad him to do hi homework he often went on long bike ride and wa therefor much happier
jane who live with her husband in aberdeen scotland insist throughout the pandem that their teenag son who ha autism continu to attend school
he ha transit issu so not leav the hous would have been hi perfect scenario she say
each day i do lot of coax and reassur and tell him thing will be ok
it doesn't work as well as it use to but school is nonnegoti
frith ha observ that social attitud about autism have shift over the past few year but not alway in help way
peopl have been through a cultur chang in understand neurodivers and autism ha becom a favourit of fiction and film say frith
but it' focuss on veri few featur in particular posit featur
the kind of autism most often be present in popular media would be categoris as mild she say
also onscreen charact with autism are often portray as be intellectu gift

future,"everi year approxim 90000 ship pass through the narrow sea lane of the malacca strait which link the indian ocean to the pacif
their cargo – grain crude oil and everi other commod under the sun – compris an estim 40 of global trade
abov these ship is one of the busiest air rout in the world and below them run along the seab is a dens array of submarin internet cabl that keep the world onlin
togeth these factor make the malacca strait one of the most vital arteri of the global economi
it ha been classifi as a trade choke point in report by the world trade organ the us energi inform administr and chatham hous the londonbas foreign affair thinktankal of which is to say nice strait you'v got there
be a shame if something… happen to itresearch are warn that it' onli a matter of time befor a natur disast like an earthquak or volcano strike the region – and when it doe we can expect global consequencesshiptrack technolog reveal just how mani travel through the malacca strait credit alamydisrupt of key trade rout is a wellestablish problem due to crime or human error
piraci ha long bedevil the area but the strait cooper polic by indonesia malaysia singapor and thailand is gener under control
still it is not uncommon for ship to collid here 10 american sailor die as a result of the uss john mccain run into a liberianflag tanker in 2017
but at 17 mile 27 km at it narrowest the strait is not slender enough to be block by an errant contain ship in the way that the suez canal wa by the 400m 1312ft ever given in 2021
the greatest menac to the malacca strait which separ the malay peninsula from the indonesian island of sumatra lie in the natur world
of the mani intrigu map of activ in the region the most arrest is the one that collat the world' activ volcano and recent earthquak
along the coast of sumatra and the more southerli part of java follow the cours of the sunda trench is a band of earthquak activ and sever volcanoeson java two volcano semeru and merapi have recent erupt
in the sunda strait which separ java from sumatra is krakatoa and further west is tambora whose erupt in 1815 caus crop failur as far afield as in europ and the eastern unit statesth tambora erupt wa magnitud vei7 in the volcan explos index vei on a logarithm scale go up to vei8
an event like 1815 might occur onc or twice per millennium
but an erupt need not be of quit so high a magnitud to caus sever problem at a global choke pointyou may also likein 2018 research at the univers of cambridge' centr for risk studi envisag the effect of scenario includ a vei6 erupt at marapi
the erupt they suggest might produc ash cloud and fine tephra – fragment of rock eject into the air – that waft across the malacca strait toward singapor and malaysia
the result damag to local infrastructur and suppli chain with aviat particularli badli affect would combin with a global temperatur drop of 1c to wipe an estim 251tn £2tn23tn off global gdp over a fiveyear period
that figur dwarf the estim 5bn £4bn46bn that the vei4 erupt of eyjafjallajökul in iceland wipe from the global economymarapi' last vei4 erupt wa 2010
a vei6 erupt at marapi is lowerprob it return period which is the estim averag time between erupt is 750 year
yet the stake are high enough to merit take the prospect serious say lara mani a volcanologist at the univers of cambridge' centr for the studi of existenti risk
and marapi is one of sever activ volcano in the region
vei4 vei5 and vei6 erupt say mani can still realli disrupt the strait
and the thing is when a volcano start it doesn't tell you when it' go to stop
if semeru volcano in indonesia produc a signific erupt the disrupt could be global credit alamylet' imagin that one of those activ volcano – such as semeru on java indonesia – produc an erupt that would qualifi as a vei5 or vei6
magma burst from the crater
ash belch into the sky
tremor shake local town
if the wind is southwesterli all air traffic in the malacca strait is ground
the ash fall onto the strait itself
on the surfac of the sea raft of pumic accumul
a larg and rel nearbi earthquak would be a menac of similar scale
it could caus a tsunami to hit the strait as the box day tsunami did in 2004
it would also caus turbid current – cloud of fastmov shakenup sediment – that rip across the seab
that' typic what sever cabl mani say
in the tonga erupt – hunga tongahunga ha'apai' vei5 erupt in januari 2022 – it wa turbid current that sever the cabl caus a region internet blackout
the turbid current also buri those cabl make their recoveri even harder
read more about the scale and aftermath of thi erupt from bbc news tonga erupt atlant seafloor felt pacif volcano megablaston the upsid these natur disast would caus less disrupt to global ship than the ever given did say tristan smith of univers colleg london
smith a ship expert at hi university' energi institut say that ships' machineri should be abl to cope with ash and that a tsunami is more danger to peopl on land where the wave break and is at it biggest than on sea
and presum in the case of an erupt an exclus zone would be declar forc ship to take a differ rout
the rerout of ship would have an effect on global trade say smith but the system should ultim be abl to handl it
if you have a ship that get held up by three day becaus it ha to go the long way around indonesia all that ship need to do is increas it speed by one or two knot and that delay is counteract
there'd still be the matter of the ground plane
the erupt of eyjafjallajökul prompt a sixday airspac ban result in disrupt for million of peopl
wors the sever of those cabl would caus econom pandemonium
trillion of dollar are transport through those cabl everi singl day say mani and that basic prop up our financi market
our submarin cabl are vulner and there have been accid over the year
mani highlight the break of sever submarin internet cabl by an earthquak near taiwan in 2006 leav a singl cabl connect hong kong to the rest of the world
it took 45 day to repair the other cabl and it wa veri lucki that one of them manag to surviv
imagin 45 day of noth for hong kong and the broader region
it would have been catastroph she continu not onli for hong kong but for the rest of the world
hong kong like singapor is a financi hub whose effect disappear would caus worldwid econom havoc
we just don't have redund say mani of the cabl if someth goe wrong there aren't spare to pick up the slack
and our satellit in their current state can onli handl about 3 of global commun
nearbi westport malaysia is one of the world' busiest port credit getti imagesso how can the strait be made less vulner
there is noth we can do to stop earthquak
the intergovernment oceanograph commiss and unesco have set up earlywarn system for event such as tsunami and there is an exist servic the worldwid navig warn servic that warn maritim ship of meteorolog or geolog disast
the japanes coast guard is the design coordin of the area that includ the strait of malaccaa for volcano it might one day be possibl to avert erupt by manipul the magma beneath them but we are mani year from that be a realist possibl
for now we must get better not onli at monitor volcano – even a few hours' notic of an erupt make a big differ – but at spot them
as mani warn indonesia ha more volcano than you can shake a stick at and mani of them we – the world' volcanologist – have never properli look at
elsewher the best prepar is diversif
more internet satellit would help
local countri would also bolster their resili by lay down new submarin cabl that take a differ rout to the exist one
china seem to be take thi approach to ship
for year it ha been tri to construct a canal across southern thailand obviat the need to go via the strait of malacca
the thai canal as it is known would reduc energi cost by provid a shortcut for crude oil transport but it would also add signific resili to chines ship
although the cccp is thought to see thi resili in geopolit term it might also turn out to be a use insur polici for global ship

future,"in the chilli berlin winter of 1863 two talent american palaeontologist got talk at an otherwis unremark scientif meet
the younger of the two wa a tall and handsom 23yearold name edward drinker cope who wore hi thick hair slick sideway and talk a lot
he had been sent to europ by hi genteel philadelphian famili to put an ocean between him and a young ladi they deem unsuit
the man he wa talk to wa othniel charl marsh
he'd been born to a poor farm famili in rural new york but had the benefit of a veri rich uncl to fund hi educ
at 32 year old marsh wa reserv and a littl pompou
he wore a droop walru moustach and hi hair wa begin to thinbefor they met each man wa enjoy the earli fruit of promis career studi fossil geolog and natur histori – both were talent ambiti and had access to famili money
after their berlin meet they would go on to name a roll call of the world' most icon dinosaur stegosauru triceratop diplodocu and enorm pterodactyl among themthes two men were also about to embroil themselv in one of the bitterest feud in the histori of scienc
what began amic in berlin would descend throughout their live into allconsum jealousi via subterfug spi and sabotag
their war troup would brandish weapon at one anoth over the fossilb of the western us and each man would pen lengthi charact assassin spill over dozen of thirsti page in the sensationalist pressbut as 1863 drew to a close in berlin neither of them knew anyth about all that
they spent a few day togeth and tour the citi befor part exchang address so they could keep in touchyou might also likemarsh alreadi had two degre when they first met and wa undertak further studi at the univers of berlin courtesi of hi uncl georg peabodi one of the major financi of the 19th centuri
cope had no degre though he wa alreadi accru a slew of scientif paper to hi namecop and marsh had interest in common – in particular the emerg scienc of palaeontolog
strang and often veri larg bone appar unrel to live speci had been crop up all over north america for mani year and scienc wa now catch up with them to describ the prehistor past of the contin and the worldad urgenc to the studi of fossil were hot debat on the new idea of evolut by natur select
on the origin of speci had come out a few year previous in 1859 shift the ground beneath europ and america' men of scienc and they were mostli men though they were stand on the shoulder of femal pioneer like mari an
find ancient bone that could substanti the theori of evolut by natur select wa becom a live pursuit in the unit stateswhen both cope and marsh went back to their respect home in philadelphia and new haven they brought a melt pot of idea from europ back with them
that and the acquaint who would torment them for the rest of their livescope' childhood diari from when he wa seven year old show hi interest in expedit and the natur world credit american museum of natur historyat first though the two men appear to get on exchang letter manuscript and fossil for sever year
their earli correspond wa friendli though accord to david rain wallac author of the bonehunters' reveng perhap a littl onesid
cope wrote volubl declar hi friendship and cover everi squar inch of the paper with hi terribl handwrit
hi new friend marsh wasn't quit so forthcom – where cope wa warm but impetu the gener opinion of marsh wa glacial and unlov
marsh wa taciturn say wallac
he wa veri selfdirect
he rare share ani more than he need to even with close acquaint prefer to publish hi thought and discoveri in scientif journal first
that way there wa littl risk of other steal hi ideastheir differ in charact didn't appear to put either off to begin with
in earli 1868 they went on an expedit togeth to haddonfield new jersey where marl bed – a mixtur of clay silt and other sediment – held mani cretac fossil
ten year befor cope' mentor joseph leidi had identifi one of the first dinosaur bone in the us at haddonfield and mentor and student had gone on to explor the fossil bed togeth
with characterist candour the enthusiast young cope share with hi friend marsh some of the area' most promis site for fossil hunt
cope knew the area well and togeth they discov three new dinosaur that seasonth rich offer of haddonfield' fossil bed made a deeper impress on marsh than cope anticip
when cope later return to hi old haunt alon he wa no longer abl to excav fossil for himself – marsh had paid the site manag to pledg all the bone found in the area to him alon
it wa perhap marsh' first overt transgress of their friendshipth name of the speci they dedic to each other in the year that follow reveal grow tension
cope made the first move declar a rather modest amphibian new to scienc to be call ptyoniu marshii in 1869
marsh respond after a while with a gigant serpent he name mosasauru copeanu – howev thi specimen wa from one of the quarri that cope show marsh note sarah shelley a postdoctor research in palaeontolog at the univers of edinburgh who ha studi cope' earli mammal
in the same year cope describ anoth specimen which he name mosasauru depressu she saysth onli got wors from therew may never get to the bottom of exactli who start it – marsh left or cope right credit alamymarsh may have been deviou but cope had hi own flaw which contribut to the greatest mistak of hi careerit happen when remain of a larg fossil skeleton were dug up from western kansa and sent to cope for identif
cope describ the fossil as a speci new to scienc which he name elasmosauru platyuru
it wa a marinedwel reptil that live dure the cretac relat to plesiosaur measur around 40ft 12m from tip to tail
it possess a tail of great length which wa elev compress and adapt for scull the ponder bodi through the water
the limb appear to have been disproportion small cope wrote to the academi of natur scienc of philadelphia
the animal' head and neck howev pose some problem
he note that the loos rock and sediment around the fossil appear to conceal some crucial detail of the structureon much larger detail howev escap hi attent
when he reconstruct the skeleton hi old associ marsh and leidi both came to see it both had their reserv about cope but the 28yearold wa prove to be prodigi in hi discoveri of remark new speciesth reptile' head as hi colleagu saw almost immedi wa ala on the wrong end perch at the tip of the animal' tail
as cope first reconstruct it e platyuru had an extraordinarili long tail and a short neck
it should have been the other way round
he misidentifi the neck vertebra and tail vertebra and vice versa say david bainbridg palaeontologist and veterinari anatomist at the univers of cambridg
thi wa partli becaus the skull wa found near what we now know to be the tail vertebra
bone do often get jumbl up between death and fossilis
howev it is possibl to work out 'which way round' vertebra are
the first to point out the error in print wa leidi who also use the opportun to correct a compar error of hi own at the same time
cope claim leidi didn't bother to tell him about the paper on hi mistak befor it came out in print wallac note
later on marsh would claim that he wa the one to first point the error out to cope – say that cope took it badli and becam enrag
whether or not he lost hi temper cope clearli felt embarrass by hi mistak
in hi later sketch of e platyuru the head had migrat to the other endcop wa notori hasti in hi academ work publish more than 75 paper a year at hi peak – mani of them short and slapdash
but put e platyurus' head at the end of the tail wa anoth level from hi usual minor inexactitud
as historian jane davidson of the univers of nevada reno write the question wa and remain how could cope have made such a seemingli obviou mistak in reconstruct e
platyuru
davidson argu that leidi cope' mentor would not have been like to wait year to point out hi mentee' mistak or to do it in print first rather than in person
leidi wa a gentl and agreeabl person who sport a beard as bushi as marsh' and hair as thick as cope' and he disapprov of cope' warlik approach to palaeontolog
more like davidson suggest wa that leidi spoke to cope about the error earli on but cope wa too proud to correct hi mistak
we are deal here with an exampl of cope' wellknown arrog davidson writesthough leidi spot it first marsh would make full use of cope' error for the rest of hi career and bring it up with relish whenev he want to cast doubt on hi rival' competenceelasmosauru platyuru would have been a fearsom predat given a head in the correct posit credit alamysoon after their joint expedit to new jersey marsh move west to have better access to even richer fossil bed in the western badland
he wa begin to make a name for himself
hi uncl had fund the new peabodi museum at yale and as part of the bargain establish a posit for hi nephew marsh who would be the university' first professor of palaeontologyh may have land hi posit through famili connect but marsh show himself to not onli be good at hi chosen career but to have an innat grasp of polit newspap and how both could be bent to hi advantag
on one expedit in 1868 marsh stop off in syracus to take a look at a renown discoveri that had been all over the paper
the find wa the onondaga giant – appar an enorm petrifi man who had been dug up on a farm in onondaga counti
after a peremptori look at the giant who wa be shown at a dime a ticket marsh spot the hoax – clear tool mark in the crevic of the block of gypsum from which the man had been carv
marsh went back to catch hi train
he settl down to debunk the discoveri and soon hi name wa in paper across the countrymarsh wa perhap the first palaeontologist who knew how to feed and manipul the public' fascin with ancient find
a lot of the media excit for palaeontolog began then especi with marsh say wallac
cope never wa abl to manipul the press veri well
nor did cope' hasti publish style allow him to establish hi reput intern to the same degre as marsh who publish less frequent but with more care reserv hi articl for the most prestigi journal
cope struggl too to gain influenc with funder of expedit so often had to pay for hi work out of pocketwhat cope lack in polit and media acumen he made up for with hi power of imagin
he would write excit letter from hi expedit back to hi wife anni pim cope and when she wa older hi daughter julia biddl cope
from a dig in kansa he told anni of the remark abund of fossil in the landscap if the explor search the bottom of rainwash and ravin he will doubtless come upon the fragment of a tooth or jaw and gener find a line of such piec lead to an elev posit on the bank or bluff where lie the skeleton of some monster of the ancient sea
pictur these longdead creatur wa as much a part of cope' work as analys their bone
when consid giant pterodactyl he saw how these strang creatur flap their leatheri wing over the wave and often plung seiz mani an unsuspect fish or soar at a safe distanc view the sport and combat of the more power saurian at sea
at nightfal we may imagin them troop to the shore and suspend themselv to the cliff by the clawbear finger of their winglimb
the awe with which cope spoke about dinosaur could be infecti one of hi field assist recal
when cope began to speak of the wonder anim of the earth those of long ago and those of today so absorb did he becom in hi subject that he talk on as if to himself look straight ahead and rare turn toward me while i listen entranc the assist wrotea wallac argu in hi book if ani one american naturalist wa the inspir for the prehistor imag that have captur the 20th century' imagin it wa cope
marsh' uncl georg peabodi fund the creation of the grand new peabodi museum at yale to hous palaeontolog specimen credit peabodi museuma decad after the elasmosauru incid howev cope and marsh' rivalri wa start to absorb them more than the fossil they work on
cope had lost hi friendli candour when talk to fellow palaeontologist about fossil site and marsh had develop an elabor system of codenam with hi alli to refer to cope jone money ammunit success in fossil collect health and even pterodactyl dragno sooner than marsh would get a notic of a new and gigant dinosaur to press in juli 1877 describ an anim found near golden citi stretch 5060ft 1518mlong and larger than ani other land anim known at the time than cope would find a bigger one
in august he announc a creatur that exce in it proport ani other land anim hitherto discov includ the one found near golden citi
he call it camarasauru supremu
they want to outdo each other and name more say shelley

chlorin may lead to format of compound that are suspect carcinogen and which may either end up in drink water as a result of industri process of fruit and veget or remain on the producewhen it come to plastic mani of us feel guilti about the amount they use
accord to david mcclement a food scientist at the univers of massachusett there is now a big push to replac plastic and find other way to preserv fruit and veget that don't involv chemic treatment

future,"million of year ago thylacin also known as tasmanian tiger were widespread across australia
about the size of an american coyot these doglik creatur with stripe disappear from the mainland around 2000 year ago
they remain in tasmania until the 1920 when they were slaughter by european colonis who saw them as a threat to livestock
it wa a humandriven extinct – european settler came to australia and brutal obliter thi anim say andrew pask a geneticist at the univers of melbournepask is lead a team of scientist who togeth with deextinct compani coloss bioscienc aim to recreat the wolflik creatur and bring it backthank to recent advanc in genet name the advent of gene edit technolog crisprcas9 the thylacin is not the onli lost speci that we could soon see again
how doe the scienc of deextinct work and what kind of ethic question doe it rais
you may also likein the case of the thylacin the first step is sequenc the extinct animal' dna – the genet blueprint contain in everi singl cell of the bodi
pask did thi in 2017
the great thing about the thylacin is that as it wa such an import marsupi everi major museum want one in their collect so there are hundr of sampl around the globe and some are except preserv say paskwellpreserv exampl of thylacin have allow the animal' dna to be sequenc credit sydney morn heraldgetti imagesour sampl wa a babi taken from it mothers' pouch
they shot the mum and immedi drop the babi into alcohol which preserv dna
that wa the miracl specimen and the holi grail for us in term of be abl to realli build that genom
although it' in pretti good condit the dna isn't complet whole
over time exposur to uv light and the action of bacteria break down dna into short fragment
the older the sampl the smaller the fragment that are left behind until eventu there isn't enough left there' no chanc of bring back a dinosaur for thi reasonthi leav scientist with the seemingli imposs task of work out how the variou bit of dna fit togeth – a task compar to complet an enorm jigsaw without the help pictur on the front of the boxluckili a small mouses marsupi call a dunnart wa abl to provid a blueprint
we found the closest live rel to the thylacin which wa the dunnart say paskdunnart and thylacin share 95 of their dna which is thought to be highli conserv mean it hasn't chang much over time
we sequenc the dunnart' genom and compar that genet code to our extinct speci we then overlap them and found everywher where it wa differ say paskhowev know an animal' dna is simpli not enough to bring it back
the next stage of the puzzl involv tweak the gene of the dunnart so that they match the thylacine'
thi can be done with crisprcas9 the nobel prizewin genom edit method
we start with live cell from the dunnart and we begin to edit all of those chang so we essenti engin or turn that dunnart cell into a live thylacin cell with thylacin chromosom in it say paskprevi gene edit wasn't advanc enough to be abl to chang all of the differ sequenc to thylacin dna in one go
with million of edit need it wa assum that research would need to prioritis the most import dna sequenc yield an anim genom that wasn't exactli the same as the extinct one
pask believ thi will no longer be necessari
all of those technolog are in place but nobody' done it on thi scale befor becaus the dnaedit technolog wasn't good enough or quick enough
but now it' come such a long way that we do have that tech and we have had signific invest to tri and make thi work
onc the research have a thylacin cell they still need to turn it into a develop embryo and then implant it into a live closerelative' womb
if that sound easi then it isn't
we have a lot of work to do say pask
we'v alreadi made marsupi stem cell which took us about five year
we'r now put those stem cell into embryo to see if we can get them to develop into a whole live anim
the tini dunnart ha been abl to help scientist fill in the gap of the extinct thylacine’ dna credit auscapegetti imagescrisprcas9 wa develop by the nobelpr win scientist emmanuel charpenti and jennif a doudna in 2012

the result hybrid known as a mammophant' would be adapt to the cold siberian tundra and could help fill an ecolog void left by the mammoth when they went extinct
watch a film from bbc reel about how mammoth might be a surpris help in tackl climat chang or watch it below
there are howev limit with the technolog and obstacl that still need to be overcom
mani attribut that we have as live anim requir sever differ copi of gene but it' not easi to tell from look at a reconstruct genom how mani are need say michael archer a palaeontologist at the univers of new south wale in sydney australia
you keep your finger cross that one copi will be suffici to enabl the featur you'r look for but there' a big suckitandse compon to these project
howev genom reconstruct is not the onli method scientist could use to resurrect extinct animalsth auroch a type of prehistor cow is the subject of ancient cave paint around the globe
it onc roam the plain of europ and stood as tall as an eleph
it becam extinct in the 1600
although long gone auroch gene can still be found in variou breed of cattl around the contin with descend in spain portug itali and the balkan
geneticist are now back breed these speci togeth to produc offspr closer to the qualiti of an aurochanoth idea is to essenti clone the dead anim by take the nucleu from an intact cell and then transfer it into the egg of a close live rel in the hope that an embryo will formth caveat is that you need a complet cell to do thi and cell quickli break down after death
an anim like the thylacin that die out almost a hundr year ago simpli couldn't be brought back thi waybut it could be an option for recent extinct speciesin 2003 research success clone a pyrenean ibex a type of goat that went extinct when the last live individu wa kill by a fall tree
sadli the newborn die of a lung defect shortli after birtharch is current use a variat of clone technolog to bring back the southern gastricbrood frog a speci nativ to queensland which becam extinct in 1983
the creatur had a bizarr method of reproduct swallow it fertilis egg and use it stomach as a sort of wombin 2013 he complet the first step – transfer the nucleu from a frozen frog cell into the empti egg of a close relat amphibian
incred the cell start divid and an embryo wa form
we did it mani hundr of time and it didn't work and then suddenli one of them did and we saw thi hybrid embryo start to divid under the microscop and it wa veri excit say archeraft thi initi excit howev the project stumbl when none of the embryo develop into tadpol or frog
the frog embryo develop into a ball of cell which is normal embryon develop but then they stop say archer
normal the outsid layer of cell fold in and you get a twolay structur which lead to a tadpol but our didn't do that
the same thing happen when the team tri to creat an embryo with two live speci of frog suggest that it wa an aspect of their experiment work that wa interf with the develop of the embryo rather than a problem with the extinct frog' dna
we'r work to find out what thi obstacl is in live frog befor we can go back to the extinct animal' dna say archerth auroch wa a form of prehistor cow which roam the plain of europ befor disappear in the 1600 credit fine artgetti imagesar we play godeven if we can bring back extinct anim there are ethic considerationsreintroduc mammoth and thylacin might upset exist ecosystem
sinc these anim becam extinct other will have evolv and adapt to fill their place
will these organ suffer as a resultthank to climat chang the environ these creatur onc live in may have chang drastic
some of the plant woolli mammoth fed on are long gone as well
would mammoth still be abl to surviv on their own in the wild and if not who would look after them
would they just end up as curios in a zoo
i don't think we should bring all anim back
i think it should have to fit certain criteria say pask
for the thylacin it' a recent extinct event so it habitat in tasmania still exist all the food it use to eat still exist so there' somewher for them to go and they can thrive again in that environ
thi anim also play a critic role in the ecosystem
it wa an apex predat so it sat right at the top of the food chain
there are no other marsupi apex predat so when it wa made extinct it left a massiv gap
some research argu that effort to bring back longgon speci could detract from conserv effort to save exist anim and even increas the risk of biodivers loss and that peopl may be less incentivis to stop eat meat and destroy habitatsbut deextinct technolog could be use to save live speci on the brink of extinct especi those with an extrem small gene pool like the white rhinoblack head ferret are one of north america' most endang anim – everi ferret aliv today can trace it ancestri to just seven individu
yet research at santiago zoo in chile recent took frozen cell from a black foot ferret which die 30 year ago and use them to creat a clone elizabeth ann
elizabeth' dna is entir differ so she can bring a welcom boost of genet divers into the popul
deextinct tech isn't just about bring back the thylacin it' about prevent other anim from becom extinct say pask
we have so mani bush fire in australia and with rise global temperatur we are go to see more advers weather event in the decad to come
what australia ha been do is collect tissu from marsupi in those area that are most at risk and freez them
thi mean that if a bush fire came along onc the veget grew back you could repopul that area with that speci
archer agre that the moral right outweigh ani wrong
i think it would be uneth not to do it
i think the ethic issu here wa the improprieti of human make these anim extinct in the first place
it' not about play god thi is about play smart human by undo what we did

while thi is slightli earlier than previous believ perhap more surprisingli the research also conclud that all modern donkey live today appear to be descend from thi singl domest eventprevi studi have suggest howev that there may have been other attempt at domest donkey in yemen
interestingli thi first domest of donkey in eastern africa coincid with the aridif of a oncegreen sahara
an abrupt weaken of the monsoon from around 8200 year ago combin with increas human activ in the form of graze and burn led to a decreas in rainfal and the gradual spread of the desert and the sahel region
domest donkey may have been crucial for adapt to thi increasingli harsh environ
we believ due to the climat chang the local human popul had to adapt say orlando
in donkey they could leverag an essenti servic of transport larg amount of load over long distanc and difficult landscap
they notic that the donkey popul also appear to have undergon a dramat decreas in popul size after it wa initi domest befor sharpli increas again
thi is someth typic of domest and seen in almost everi domest speci at a point in time say evelyn todd a popul geneticist at the centr for anthropobiolog and genom of toulous who wa also involv in the studi
the decreas is the result of select a specif stock of donkey for domest and later breed it purpos which contribut to their sharp increas
their analysi suggest that donkey then appear to have radiat out from east africa be trade northwest to sudan and onward into egypt where the remain of donkey have been found at archaeolog site date back up to 6500 year ago
over the follow 2500 year thi new domest speci spread throughout europ and asia develop the lineag that are found todayaccord to archaeologist laerk recht at the univers of graz in austria donkey made a huge differ in humanity' abil to transport good over long distanc by land due to the animals' endur and abil to carri heavi burden

they are radiocarbon date to 4500yearsold and have a genet makeup similar to the modern asian subpopul say todd
it suggest the asian subpopul of the domest donkey split from other lineag around thi timeth research also confirm that donkey have been a far more constant companion of human than their equin rel hors
modern domest hors which were domest around 4200 year ago have had such a big impact on human histori say orlando

future,"at midnight on 1 juli 1982 china began a mammoth undertak
the goal to find out how mani peopl there were in the countri at that exact moment in time
no one had check sinc 1964 so it wa anyone' guess what they would find
after year of prepar arm with 29 comput purchas for the task – includ at least 21 import from the us under a special exempt – and five million train personnel they would spend the come month dilig count the member of everi household in the countrybi octob that same year the result were in the new york time ran the headlin china pop
1008175288 onefourth of the world
decad of growth had rais the country' popul to the stagger new threshold of a billion peopl
a babi wa born there everi two secondschina' onechild polici wa introduc in 1980 with the explicit object of reduc popul growth to zero
but though it ran for anoth 36 year until 2016 it is onli now that china ha enter neg growth – it number have start shrink for the first time in 60 year
accord to data releas by china' nation bureau of statist the nation wa home to 14118 billion peopl in 2022 which is 850000 fewer than there were in 2021
it reflect a declin in the country' birth rate which ha been fall over the past six year to reach a record low of 677 birth per 1000 peopleth chang ha been met with both alarm and optim – includ concern about what thi mean for the global economi and the hope that continu prosper might not be as depend on have a grow popul as ha histor been assum
the chariti popul matter ha suggest that china' stabilis number should be celebr for their potenti environment benefit and the welfar of the country' citizensbut such a stark demograph shift in the world' most popul countri rais mani uncertainti and implic for the futur
is china' newli declin popul realli a surpris
and how will it affect the planet
bbc futur look at five of the big question to get to grip with thi storywhi ha it taken so long for china' popul to shrinkin 1991 within just a few year of the onechild polici kick in china' birth rate had fallen to below replac level
each woman wa have fewer children than the number requir to maintain the popul size from one gener to the next
in most countri thi is usual around 21 – one for each woman one for her partner and an extra 01 to counteract those that die as infantschina is the world' largest consum of natur resourc such as fossil fuel though the us ha the higest use per capita credit getti imagesin the year that follow china' continu growth wasn't becaus the controversi initi had fail – it wa down to a counterintuit effect known as demograph momentum
thi explain how a popul with constant level of mortal and zero migrat can continu to increas for decad even when women are have fewer than 21 childrenit' all down to the time delay between birth and death
until recent china' popul wa rel youth with an averag age of 35 in 2010 compar to 443 in germani now it' 384
at the same time peopl have been live longer – in 2021 the country' life expect overtook that of the us
so though the number of babi born per woman declin drastic there were still more babi be born than there were peopl dyingthi ha now chang howev
it' thought that the drop in fertil rate and slight increas in report death dure the covid19 pandem may have play a role in acceler a declin in china' absolut number though it ha been long anticip
in thi seri bbc futur take a look at topic stori through the len of the most press question the kind you'd need to ask to put a new develop in context or explain it to a friendwil china' drop in number affect predict for the total global populationaccord to the un' world popul prospect report for 2022 china' popul wa predict to declin in 2023 – the reduct recent reveal by the country' censu had been expect for some time
in fact the shift ha onli come slightli earlythi mileston in china' demograph ha alreadi been factor into mani project for global popul growth
base on the expect that the country' popul would start to shrink in 2023 along with it predict for other countri the un expect that the total number of human on the planet will continu to expand to reach 85 billion by 2030 and peak at 104 billion by 2086
thi is the medium scenario in which the birth rate of nation with high fertil will mellow while those with low fertil rate will see margin increasesindia is set to becom the world' most popul countri thi year credit getti imagesthi is happen in china now but it' not happen in the rest of the world it won't happen on a global level for anoth 63 year say alistair curri head of campaign and commun at popul mattersmost of the growth will happen in subsaharan africa which is project to contribut to more than half of the popul increas between now and 2050
the headcount in the region is project to doubl in that time with nigeria take the slot as the fourth most popul countri on the planetaccord to shuang chen assist professor in the depart of social polici at the london school of econom focus on china' sheer number would be miss the point – though she acknowledg that from thi perspect the declin might be benefici for climat changechina wa respons for 27 of the carbon dioxid emit into the atmospher in 2022 and the countri is current build over half of the new coalfir power plant on the planet
but what' realli caus concern social is what that mean in term of the structur
becaus thing are chang realli fast… societi may not have time to adapt say chen

thi is mostli down to two factor fertil rate have remain high while mortal rate have gone down due to improv in medicin
then there' the population' age structur
india' popul is around a decad younger than china' on averag so there are more peopl of childbear age in totalhow doe china' fertil rate compar with those of other countrieschina' fertil rate ha been steadili declin sinc the 1990 to an alltim low of 128 in 2020
for comparison there were 205 birth per woman in india the same year and 164 in the us
even japan with it notori low birth rate and age popul had a fertil rate of 134china is home to sever of the most popul citi on earth credit getti imagesth steep downward trajectori of china' reproduct power is thought to be down to a number of factorsfor one thing there is an imbal between men and women in china
the onechild polici left the countri with a skew sex ratio there wa a tradit prefer for boy with mani girl be abort abandon or even kill
in some age group there are now more than 11 men for everi 10 women
– indic that one in everi 11 men will struggl to find a partner the same age
other factor are thought to includ the rise cost of live and a trend toward get marri later in lifebut there are also shift valu
survey after survey ha reveal that chines women now view the ideal number of children as one two or zero despit the introduct of a twochild polici in 2015
these issu were compound dure the covid19 pandem when resent about lockdown and other restrict led to the hashtag wearethelastgener trend on social media
will china' popul continu shrinkingov the past 200 year or so mani industrialis countri have undergon a demograph transit – after first grow at a rapid pace their popul eventu transit from have high birth and death rate to low birth and death rate
china is consid to be a posttransit societi which ha alreadi complet thi cyclehowev it' less clear what will happen next
china' fertil rate are expect to continu to declin particularli as the popul age and there are fewer women of childbear age overal
but there are two big unknownson is migrat
china' level of immigr are current extrem low but curri explain that thi could chang as the countri attempt to grow it economi
then there' the possibl impact of measur the govern is take to encourag citizen to reproduc
at the moment they are not prove particularli effect but some expert are concern that they may adopt more coerciv tactic

future,"in late octob 2022 epidemiologist and infecti diseas expert around the world began to notic an unsettl trenda the epidemiologist adam kucharski explain in a twitter thread there wa a new wave of covid19 afoot – but it wa go larg unnot
today the alarm spike of covid19 death and hospitalis which we had all becom familiar with dure the grim day of 2020 and 2021 have been replac by a more insidi but unrel success of daili fatalitiesa an exampl let’ take a figur for 21 decemb 2022 – 133 covid19 relat death in england accord to the uk govern websit – a number which may sound unremark compar to 2020 when peopl were be kill in their thousand by the viru in the same week in the us 2919 peopl die from covid19
but as kucharski point out over time even low level of death can accumul to a strike perhap even shock numberin the whole of 2022 the same databas reveal that 46099 peopl had perish from covid19 in england – the govern are no longer record thi data for the whole uk
thi is not quit the 75240 death in 2020 or the 74558 in 2021 but still more than most might expect
in contrast over the cours of a particularli bad influenza season around 30000 peopl in the uk might die from flu and pneumoniayet within the corridor of westminst and even newsroom across the countri these ongo death bare merit a mention compar to the myriad other crise on the agenda from the cost of live to energi bill
and thi is not just happen in the uk – across the globe covid19 ha been simmer away for monthsscientist admit that it would like take someth drastic such as the impact of a new supervari for thi to chang
or as kucharski put it we have becom so focus on the peak of the curv when it come to covidrel death we have overlook how thi creep toll of fatal can still ultim add up to a veri signific number
we saw thi with the delta variant in 2021 say kucharski
it wasn't a veri sharp peak but it wa much much longer and so the actual overal number of hospitalis wa quit similar to 2020
they were just distribut over a much longer period of time becaus the viru wasn’t sweep through the popul in the same way he saysthi winter the northern hemispher ha been experienc a twindem of covid19 and the flu credit getti imagesth same trend ha been seen in the us where some 20003000 american are still die from covid19 everi week
the harvard univers epidemiologist william hanag say that he wrote to report at one larg media organis in juli last year inform them that if the ongo weekli death toll wa extrapol to a full year it would be equival to three particularli devast flu season
but such news no longer automat make headlin
the number are actual realli quit larg say hanag
but one of the thing that happen with human is that thing which are constant just becom part of the everyday
between januari and novemb 2022 more than 248000 american had die from the viru
you could be forgiven for wonder how we have all becom so inur to these number as if such a degre of mortal is now littl more than mundan
we'v come to realli pay attent when there are veri larg spike say deni nash an epidemiologist at the citi univers of new york
that ha creat the situat where peopl now are less like to pay attent to what' happen unless there' someth big reflect in the data
but when you start to look at it over time it realli is scari how mani death are still happen today
for nash and other one of the frustrat is that mani of the fatal feel highli preventableboost hesitancybehind the endless graph and visual on govern websit it is surprisingli hard to drill down into the number to fulli understand who is still die from covid19
while epidemiologist had all kind of demograph inform to work with in 2020 and 2021 budget cut have meant that it is now much more difficult to answer these kind of question both in the uk and on the other side of the atlanticfor nash these cutback repres a grave public health error
if you realli did a good job of profil who wa be hospitalis or who is die over the last five or six month you could get a sens of who' fall through the crack and whi he say
what we'r talk about is not even research but a basic function of public health that is miss at the state local and nation level
it' thought that china ha been have a major spike in covid19 case sinc restrict were lift in decemb credit getti imagesinstead the narr of these death can onli realli be piec togeth by speak to the doctor on the frontlin in hospit
accord to william schaffner professor of infecti diseas at vanderbilt univers medic centr in nashvil tennesse they still tend to be those who were most vulner in the earli day of the pandem
the peopl we’r see hospitalis tend to be those who are either older or younger peopl who are immun compromis whether due to an ill or a medicin which suppress their immun system say schaffner
it’ a lot of high risk group
andrew ustianowski a consult at north manchest gener hospit paint a similar pictur
the death i could think that i'v been involv in recent have been peopl that have been larg veri immunosuppress or veri frail and covid therefor ha a bigger impact he say
it also doesn't alway mean that they die of covid
they might have caught covid in hospit but it wa actual their underli diseas that kill them
mani doctor feel that one of the ongo problem which make these individu even more vulner is the sluggish uptak of booster vaccin even in highrisk group
while in the uk all over 50 and anyon younger with underli health condit qualifi for a booster jab on the nh thi autumn – a total of 26 million elig individu – the latest statist show that onli half of those peopl have receiv their vaccin so far
booster hesit is even more concern in the us with onli 296 of american over 65 receiv their latest dosether are mani reason for thi trend from issu with vaccin access and vaccin hesit foster by polit tension and misinform to covid apathi with both politician and the gener public keen to move on
in septemb presid biden infam declar that the pandem is over while public health messag ha becom dilut by other emerg issu such as monkeypox polio and hospit strain under the burden of a twoyear backlog of postpon oper
read more about monkeypox from bbc futur
but while miss a booster might have littl impact on rel healthi individu who have mostli accumul hybrid immun from both past infect and vaccin evid ha repeatedli shown that vaccineinduc protect wane rapidli in the most vulner
in march 2022 one studi found that immun drop markedli among elderli care home resid after just three monthsscientist feel that govern and public health offici need to do more to ensur that the most atrisk are fulli awar of the import of ongo jab
i would argu that the ongo cost of covid should be less than we are toler say hanag
we could make it less certainli in the unit state by vaccin peopl better
societi through a combin of polit inattent and pandem fatigu ha stumbl into the current situat
i know of peopl who die unawar that they were elig for booster that would have like save their live
the new omicron variant xbb
15 ha been spread rapidli in recent month and is alreadi widespread in the unit state credit getti imagesprotect the vulnerablebecaus the ongo impact of covid19 is even more disproport target toward the most vulner question are be ask as to whether societi as a whole should do more to protect them and find way to mitig the ongo death tollemma hodcroft an epidemiologist at the institut for social and prevent medicin at the univers of bern point out that switzerland ha offer the latest round of booster vaccin to all over 18 and suggest that thi strategi could be appli more wide
boost younger age group can make a differ by cut transmiss she say
that could protect someon in one of those vulner group from get covid and have a realli bad outcom
in octob 2022 scientist discov a new variant of covid19 circul in new york
it wa name xbb 15 and it ha been describ as the greatgrandchild of omicron
the viru is thought to have form when two omicron substrain infect the same person and swap some of their gene to produc even more infecti offspringsinc it wa first identifi xbb 15' conquest ha been rapid
as of earli januari 2023 it ha alreadi spread to 28 countri and outcompet ten of other variant in the unit state to becom one of the most domin make up around 28 of case
so far the viru doe not seem to be ani more lethal than it competitor howev scientist are concern that it may continu to spread globallywhil antivir such as paxlovid have been credit with reduc mortal their rollout hasn't gone entir smoothli
the uk purchas 498 million dose of antivir at the end of 2021 but to date onli a small fraction have been use while in the us there have been question as to whether paxlovid ha been appropri target toward those who realli need it
doctor are sceptic as to whether everi singl person with covid should be on an antivir which is understand say nash
i think it should be just use in peopl who are much older – even if they'v been vaccin and boost they should be prioritis becaus of wane immun
or it should be use in the unvaccin and peopl with comorbid
there are also fear that monoclon antibodi – lab grown protein which supplement the body’ immun system – such as regeneron’ regencov and astrazeneca’ antibodi cocktail evusheld which have been credit with save the live of mani peopl with compromis immun system are rapidli wane in effect against newer variantsa a result hanag say that while emerg variant such as bq 11 – a subvari of the omicron variant – will like have littl impact at a popul level they will like contribut to the steadi ongo death toll amongst the most vulner
it seem pretti clear that monoclon antibodi therapi for peopl who need them are go to be less effect he say
and what that mean is that some of the most vulner peopl are go to be more like to struggl with infect with the virus that we'r go to see over thi winter
but becaus they are a minor i think that we unfortun tend to discount them
ongo surveillancein mani way the origin inequ of the pandem have onli becom larger the longer it ha progress
scientist say that there are measur we can take to tri and stem the insidi ongo death from the viru but these all requir a degre of societ willing to make sacrific from wear mask on public transport to break transmiss chain or improv the ventil of buildingsup to 90 of peopl in the chines provinc of henan have recent been infect with covid19 accord to health offici credit getti imagesi think it is import to rememb that while thing are in a much better state than a coupl of year ago it isn't equal for everyon say hodcroft
by take step like increas ventil to keep transmiss down the easier we make it for peopl who are at highest risk of continu to die from covid
but it can be complic becaus you have to convinc whoever own the build that thi is worth do
at a govern level decis have to be made as to whether to invest larg amount of money in procur newer version of monoclon antibodi which can protect a minor of citizen against the ongo variantsschaffn told the bbc that on the centr for diseas control and prevention’ latest confer call it wa reveal that the ineffect of these antibodi is alreadi becom a seriou problem in some part of the us
but the bleak realiti is that onc again much of the dilemma come down to a costbenefit ratio
around 3 of the us popul have compromis immun system and scientist have estim that it will like cost around 200m £164m to produc newer antibodi run trial and get them authoris by regulatorsepidemiologist warn that if we are too complac about continu to understand who is die from the viru and whi we will like be unprepar if the tide shift
monitor covid19 ha never been more complex – the sheer variat in popul immun combin with a rapid success of everevolv variant ha creat a situat where it is almost imposs to predict when a new wave of case will come
equal it' becom more difficult to identifi if one variant is suddenli more virul than those that have preced it
thi make a degre of ongo surveil and data collect all the more import
with everi few month we are see that the amount of effort and money that' go into thi kind of data collect is go down say hodcroft
the question for me alway is how do we make sure that we'v got enough data so that if there is a chang we'll actual be abl to see it
and make recommend or warn or whatev need to be done
at the same time doctor say that while ani death is tragic there ha to be a degre of pragmat when it come to the impact of covid19
ustianowski point out that mani healthcar system in the world ultim have limit resourc and while the ongo death from the viru are all entir prevent if vaccin or antivir had been administ in a time manner so are mani death from heart diseas or mening or other chronic ill
we do have intervent that can prevent peopl deterior he say
are we catch everybodi we need to
no not by a long way
is there still room for improv with the intervent
ye
but you’r never go to have a perfect situat and that is the state of all area in the health system
if we interven at the age of 30 with peopl smoke we'd have less lung cancer and we'd have less heart diseas later on
so there’ got to be a bit of realism in there as well

future,"when british brain surgeon henri marsh sat down besid hi patient' bed follow surgeri the bad news he wa about to deliv stem from hi own mistak
the man had a trap nerv in hi arm that requir an oper – but after make a midlin incis in hi neck marsh had drill out the nerv on the wrong side of hi spinal columnprevent medic mistak frequent involv wrongsid surgeri an inject to the wrong eye for exampl or a biopsi from the wrong breast
these never event – seriou and larg prevent patient safeti accid – highlight that while most of us learn as children how to tell left from right not everyon get it rightwhil for some peopl tell left from right is as easi as tell up from down a signific minor – around one in six peopl accord to a recent studi – struggl with the distinct
even for those who believ they have no issu distract such as ambient nois or have to answer unrel question can get in the way of make the right choic
nobodi ha difficulti in say someth is front and back or top and bottom say inek van der ham professor of neuropsycholog at leiden univers in the netherland
but tell left from right is differ she say
it' becaus of the symmetri and becaus when you turn around it' the other way around and that make it so confus
leftright discrimin is actual quit a complex process call upon memori languag visual and spatial process and mental rotat
in fact research are onli just begin to get to the bottom of exactli what' go on in our brain when we do it – and whi it' much easier for some peopl than othersform us presid donald trump wa briefli flummox when leader were ask to cross hand at a summit in the philippin in 2017 credit afpgetti imagesaround one in 10 peopl are lefthand and studi on twin have shown that genet ha a role to play
a studi at the univers of oxford recent reveal four region in human dna that seem to play a role in determin if someon is left or right handedthos who were lefthand were found to have mutat in four gene that code for the body' cytoskeleton – the complex scaffold that sit within cell to help organis them
scan of peopl with these mutat show that the white matter in their brain had a differ structur
the left and right side of the brain of lefthand peopl were also better connect than in righthand peopl
some individu can tell right from left innat just can do it without think say gerard gormley a gp and clinic professor at queen' univers belfast in northern ireland
but other have to go through a process
in an effort to understand what happen in wrongsid medic error gormley and hi colleagu have conduct research on medic students' experi of make leftright decis and examin the process
first of all you have to orient right from left in yourself he say
when the answer doesn't come instantli particip describ variou techniqu from make an l shape with their thumb and index finger to think about which hand they use to write or strum a guitar
for some peopl it' a tattoo on their bodi or a pierc gormley saysthen when figur out which side is someon else' left or right the next step is mental rotat yourself so you'r face in the same direct as the other person
if i'm face you my left hand will be opposit your right hand say gormley
that idea of mental rotat an object add an extra degre of complex
other research show that peopl tend to find it easier to judg if an imag show a left or right hand by imagin their own hand or bodi rotatingresearch publish by van der ham and her colleagu in 2020 found that around 15 of peopl rate themselv as insuffici when it come to identifi left and right
almost half of the four hundr particip in the studi said they use a handrel strategi to identifi which is whichth research use someth call the bergen rightleft discrimin test to dig deeper into how these strategi work
particip look at pictur of stick peopl either face toward or away from them with their arm in variou posit and had to identifi their highlight hand as their left or right
it seem simpl but it' kind of frustrat if you have to do a hundr of these as quickli as you can say van der hamin the first experi the particip sat with their hand on a tabl in front of them
there wa a veri clear effect from how thi littl stick figur wa posit say van der ham
if you were look at the back of the head so it wa align with you peopl were a lot faster and more accur
similarli when the stick person wa face the particip but had their hand cross so their left hand wa on the same side as the participant' left hand peopl tend to do better
that tell us that the bodi realli is involv in thi say van der ham
the next question wa whether particip were use cue from their bodi at the time of the test to identifi left and right or refer to a store idea of their bodi insteadto answer that the research repeat their experi but thi time test four differ scenario particip sat with their hand either cross or uncross on the tabl in front of them and had their hand either visibl dure the test or cover with a black clothbut the research found that none of those chang influenc test perform

it wa veri easi for us to increas the abil of children to be abl to locat the bodi part on the basi of the name say gomezon reason for thi might be that the children were taught a strategi – to think about their write hand – for when they couldn't rememb right and left
the programme' focu on children' own bodi is anoth possibl explan especi as other research show that an egocentr refer frame is key when we make leftright decisionsin a typic classroom children might label bodi part on a diagram rather than their own bodi becaus the latter is more timeconsum and difficult to assess for a teacher say gomez

future,"it is the smell of decay and death say beth stauffer from the univers of louisiana
it ha a physic presenc
thi layer of veri strike green and blueish greens…when you put your paddl in it you can feel it
she' describ the harm algal bloom hab that use to be more associ with marin environ
but in recent year they'v been move further inland and affect freshwat system too
and scientist such as stauffer are tri to find out whyhab occur when certain kind of alga grow veri quickli due to increas nutrient in the water – typic when artifici nitrogen and phosphoru appli to farmers' field wash out in the rain and enter waterway
the alga receiv a meal on a scale they would never get natur and a bloom is form
sometim thi is harmless
but at scale mani type of alga can turn toxic and harm to human and anim
and thi scale can be extraordinaryth explos growth of algal bloom is link to rise temperatur and rise pollut
these green wave are both a warn sign and a symptom of a chang climat
as farm fertilis and a tsunami of human sewag hit our warm waterway we are in danger of turn our veri drink water toxicin the ocean a coastwid bloom of pseudonitzschia alga in spring 2015 result in an outbreak of the neurotoxin domoic acid along the entir us west coast span four state

a bloom in the gulf of mexico in 2017 wa record to cover 8776 sq mile 22720 sq kmtypic these giant bloom occur near delta where river – drain huge area of land and fertilis – meet the sea
but inland river and lake are increasingli get swamp befor they even reach the sea
and their water endang the human popul that border them

stauffer confirm that thi now occur annual on the western and eastern coast of the us
sea lion aren't feed on littl microscop organ they'r feed on fish on crustacean she say just like we do
sea lion commonli feed on fish such as anchovi
dure the 2015 incid anchovi caught in fish net were found to have veri high level neurotoxin from the algal bloomsthi is far from a usonli problem
jessica richardson a research at the centr for ecolog hydrolog lancast environ centr in the uk ha describ bloom of cyanobacteria as a threat to global water secur that is expect to increas due to a chemic and climat cocktail of nutrient enrich increas temperatur and extrem precipit in combin with prolong drought
in short more sewag and fertilis be flush into warmer water by heavi rain hit parch grounda in the us bay area in china such as zhanjiang bay rare saw hab befor the 1980 but have occur “period and frequently” sinc the 2000
norwegian fish farm were devast by a toxic algal bloom in 2019 that kill million of salmon
in scotland hab were rel unheard of until 2013 when a larg bloom off the shetland island saw 70 peopl report shellfish toxic symptom with the number affect believ to be substanti higher
hab now result in the loss of 15 of turnov to the scottish shellfish industri annuallyengland' largest and most famou lake windermer ha also start turn a troubl shade of blueishgreen
in august local campaign matt staniek went viral with a short video scoop green gunk from the lake' surfac state i got a cyanobacteria bloom test as i felt thi wasn't be taken serious enough
it exceed world health organ guidelines… windermer is not safe
from the microplast spray on farmland to the noxiou odour releas by sewag plant and the nois harm marin life pollut are seep into everi aspect of our exist
sensori overload explor the impact of pollut on all our sens and the longterm harm it is inflict on human and the natur world
read some of the other stori from the seri herestaniek a 20someth zoologist who grew up in windermer villag say that algal bloom would appear occasion when he wa a child but it ha been get progress wors note that the annual averag temperatur of the lake ha increas by 17c 3f in the last 50 year
he describ the explos of bloom as the sign of a die lakeunlik in the us howev staniek believ the nutrient load feed the bloom aren't come primarili from pesticid but from local sewag plant
in 2021 the unit util staveley sewag work near windermer spill untreat sewag into a nearbi stream 80 time for a total of 1172 hour accord to an interact map by the river trust which document sewag spill
thi wa not a one off the unit util plant at grasmer spill 90 time for a total of 1348 hour
the uk’ age sewag network is struggl to cope with intens rainfal a grow popul and an histor lack of invest
the map reveal that the whole of england and wale is in a similar sorri sewagedrench state

a video taken from 14 august which i put up on social media show a littl girl swim in amongst thi bluegreen alga

the first bloom he saw on lake eri in the 1990 wa believ to be an anomali
the subsequ 2003 bloom on lake eri wa the first realli larg notic one he say
sinc then noaa' great lake lab ha record hab get bigger ever year except for 2022 due to histor low rainfal caus less runoff from field
when the wind stop it' gross he say
there' no other way to describ it
you get thi layer of what look like thick green paint on the surfac
in the thickest bloom he' heard charter boat captain say their engin have troubl turn the propel due to the densiti of alga

in the mid2000 thi onli happen in the peak summer month juli and august
but now say stumpf the cyanobacteria season begin from earli may and can last till novemb due to global warmingth great us hab are therefor caus by a perfect storm of warmer temperatur fertilis use and an increas in heavi rainfal event which flush the fertilis out and into waterway
the intens use of commerci fertilis in the us wa 462lb per acr per year in 1960 by the year 2004 thi wa up to 146lb an increas of 215
while a recent studi by northwestern univers find that rainfal especi in the eastern us ha intensifi in the first two decad of the 21st centuri with research explain what we found is pretti simpl when it rain now it rain more
a bbc report found that the seven main water compani in england and wale discharg untreat sewag into river and the sea more than 3000 time between 2017 and 2021
whi is that happen
ask staniek
the longer thi goe on he point out the more phosphoru is store up in the sediment of lake like windermer

travel,"it wa a bright day in decemb 2021 and snow wa lightli fall over mādahòki farm an indigen visitor attract and event space just outsid ottawa canada
i wa at the pibón winter festiv and the anishinaab artist rhonda snow step on a small stage that still seem to trembl from the exuber footstep of justdepart pow wow dancer
nation renown for her vivid woodlandsstyl paint snow wa here to talk about her lifelong work preserv the endang ojibw spirit hors the breed also known as the lac la croix indian poni is the onli known indigen hors breed in canadasnow explain that she wa a young girl live in northwestern ontario when she overheard some elder talk about these small hardi hors that live free in the boreal forest
she wa captiv
i thought to myself someday i'm go to find them she saidsh travel around indigen commun and heard mani stori of indigen peoples' reciproc relationship with the ojibw spirit hors see the anim as guid and teacher
such as the méti fishermen who partner with the hors each winter to haul fish off frozen lake – although the hors were never domest back then they would use their hoov to creat ice fish hole in return for food and shelter from the fishermen
but have been cull to nearextinct by european settler who consid the wild anim a nuisanc the hors themselv were few and far betweenrhonda snow' artwork is on display at mādahòkì farm credit karen gardinerthat the breed ha surviv is due to an event snow depict in her paint titl the heist across the ice by the light of the moon
it' a stori that could have been written in hollywoodin 1977 onli four mare remain on an island in lac la croix northwestern ontario
have deem the wild anim a health risk canadian health offici made plan to slaughter them
but befor they could do so four ojibw men stage a dare rescu
they round up the mare put them on a trailer and spirit them across the frozen lake and over the border to minnesota where they were bred with a spanish mustang
care manag and select breed ha sinc reviv the ojibw spirit hors which now number around 180 and is back in canadath stori snow heard of the ojibw spirit horse' long and close relationship with indigen peopl counter the commonli accept histori of hors in north america
that stori goe that hors onc ran freeli across the contin befor go extinct dure the last ice age thousand of year ago and that they remain absent until european arriv
accord to indigen oral histori and spiritu belief howev hors have alway been on the contin they know as turtl island and recent research back them upth ojibw spirit hors is the onli known indigen hors breed in canada credit karen gardinerth spanish did bring hors to what is now mexico in 1519 but research by dr yvett run hors collin cite written spanish account that place herd in what is now georgia and the carolina in 1521
proof she argu that hors were here befor the european as collin note it would have been imposs for those spanish hors to have multipli and travel so far in just two year
when it come to the ojibw spirit hors accord to the ojibw hors societi dna test show they are a separ breed from the hors introduc to north america by europeanswhen i return to mādahòki farm in novemb 2022 i saw more evid that ojibw spirit hors have long walk thi land
cultur ambassador maggi downer who is mohawk introduc me to the farm' herd – there are no wild herd left – who were fuzzi in their winter coat and clearli built for harsh northern environ
they had compact power bodi thick mane small hairi ear and extra nose flap to protect them from the coldmukadaywagoosh black fox in ojibw gwiingwiishi grey jay and migzi eagl came rush over and push their muzzl through the fenc to be pet
downer point to twoyearold migzi' distinct ojibw mark – the tiger stripe on hi leg and wellpronounc dorsal stripe run down hi spine – that the farm hope will make a prize stud out of hima an ambassador downer say her job is to connect with the indigen commun and the nonindigen commun alik to promot awar around indigen cultur and that we'r still hereth hors are fourleg ambassador she said
thi breed face a lot of the same challeng that we did as indigen peopl
they face erad
but hors are so resili and have so much to teach us
the hors are incorpor into the farm' cultur share and educ programm credit karen gardinerth hors are an attract but also repres the farm' broader work to reclaim and celebr indigen cultur
our histori are just so similar downer said
as a young indigen woman she see a symmetri in reclaim what wa lost
becaus it wa outlaw by the canadian govern our young peopl don't know their histori
it' the same with these hors
there' that connect between us
in the farm' event space which wa set up to welcom a class particip in one of it indigen cultur school programm trina mathersimard founder of indigen experi which oper the farm told me that the idea to establish the farm wa spark when she heard rhonda snow on a podcast about ojibw spirit hors in 2020
i wa just so inspir she said
my daughter are longtim equestrian we'v had hors for year
i'm ojibw myself and i just couldn't believ i had never heard of them
i saw a lot of similar to our own stori she continu in a way that we can share easili about their connect to the land the displac and the resili that they went down to onli four of them and yet they'r still here
cultur ambassador maggi downer see the hors as fourleg ambassador credit karen gardinermathersimard and her daughter bought four hors from a farm in alberta and look for someplac to keep them
at the same time indigen experi wa search for a perman venu as it had been oper from a temporari space outsid the canadian museum of histori in gatineau quebec just across the river from ottawa
in the 164acr farm the compani found the perfect solut with so much land they could incorpor the hors into their cultur share and expand to offer landbas educationand the hors have plenti to teach said mathersimard
similar to the tradit indigen cultur of give thank for the anim that would give their life to provid food and what wa need for surviv she said our commun view our relationship with the hors as a reciproc relationship where our ancestor provid food and protect in harsh winter and the poni help the commun to surviv by help with ice fish or help to transport good and peopl
becaus the ojibw regard the hors as kindr spirit – as equal that are give back she ad – they call themselv caretak of the hors rather than ownersa well as welcom visitor to meet the hors the farm host a seri of free festiv celebr the season credit mādahòkì farmsinc open in late 2021 the farm' herd ha grown to nine – the most recent addit is a foal name giizhik cedar born in a snowstorm in april to wishkossiwika sweetgrass
as well as welcom visitor to meet the hors and visit it market stock with indigenousmad art and craft the farm host a seri of free festiv celebr the seasonswhen i attend the winter festiv i watch inuit throat singer feast on bison stew and bannock the bread associ with the indigen peopl of canada then walk through the forest along the farm' legaci trail which wa line with interpret signag describ tradit medicin use of the plant grow there
other cultur offer have includ haudenosaune corn husk dollmak a paint class led by snow and dreamcatch and moccasin workshopsth farm sit on tradit algonquin territori but it is intent inclus of mani differ indigen cultur
becaus we'r in the nation' capit we'r abl to in a small way introduc that divers said mathersimard refer to the fact that canada is home to hundr of first nation as well as inuit and méti peopleth farm also oper a culinari train programm which teach youth about tradit food product ha an equin assist learn scheme which is led by downer and incorpor the spirit hors and run art and craft workshop and busi develop class for indigen artisansi ask mathersimard about futur plan for the farm and she took a deep breath befor reel off a list of ambiti project includ the arriv of bison to provid tradit food and new forest trail for the spirit hors that more close resembl their tradit wild habitat
reconcili rock are place around the farm' legaci trail credit karen gardineri thought about how close these hors came to disappear and wa touch by the thought of be abl to watch them grow and thrive over the come year
through share indigen perspect mathersimard hope that mādahòkì which mean share the land in anishnaab can serv both as a space where indigen commun can reconnect with the land and a site of reconcili between indigen and nonindigen peopletour ha realli shift in the last few year as peopl are search out their path of reconcili she said
our industri like to say that indigen tourism is realli reconcili in action becaus it give you a tangibl way to connect with the commun and learn
at the centr of it all are the ojibw spirit hors themselv live represent of reconcili
the hors are teacher said downer

the tagimoucia is fiji' endem and elus nation flower as well as one of the rarest flower on earth

upon arriv i took a taxi to the main villag of somosomo to meet my host for the next four day a local coupl name amoreena and tabua tikoilawaqaamoreena introduc me to her 80yearold mother filomena mitchel
when i told mitchel that i hope to see the tagimoucia her eye lit up it is smaller and more delic that you would expect
i'v seen the tagimoucia twice
both time were in 1965 when i wa a nurs post to a nurs station on the east coast
back then it wa easier to go up from that side
you'll be go up from the west
it' a tough hike – go care
she urgedmeanwhil amoreena told me the famou legend of the tagimouciaamoreena and tabua tikoilawaqa are origin from the island of qamea credit ben mckechnietabua and i are from qamea the small island that lie off the coast of taveuni' northeastern tip
long ago the tribe of somosomo and qamea were at war
in a case of forbidden love the somosomo chief' daughter had promis her heart to a qamea warrior while her father had pledg her hand to anoth
the somosomo chief found out and order the qamea warrior kill
the girl climb to the peak of the island distraught and lay down in the dirt scratch and kick in devast throe at the thought of lose her lover
thi dig is how lake tagimoucia wa form and her tear becam the first tagimoucia flower
as the qamea warrior wa kill the two main colour of the flower came to repres two lover who have been separ by death in fijian cultur
in fijian cultur one should offer kava powder as a gift upon arriv in ani tribal villag in order to enter and be seen by the elder
thi is an ancient rule that appli to both fijian and visitor
as more peopl have come to tavuki to request to see the tagimoucia the villag start charg five fijian dollar in place of the bag of kava as money is of greater benefit to the communityth tagimoucia medinilla waterhousei is a speci of flower liana – longstem woodi vine that can climb tree to the canopi in search of direct sunlight
from the thin vine that sprout from the volcan soil of taveuni' mountain interior 30cmlong cluster of crimson and white tearshap petal droop down – two distinct part of the same flower
it is believ that the plant need a veri specif composit of volcan soil as all attempt to transplant the vine to other fijian island and countri have failedth next day i took a car to the villag of tavuki where the de voeux peak trailhead start
local tribal tradit dictat that befor set off in search of the tagimoucia anyon – fijian and visitor alik – must ask permiss from villag elder
amoreena had told me i need to find a man name samuela vagoni and i soon spot the bald man with a goate hammer a nail insid a tini hut
vagoni puf out hi chest clear hi throat and said by the power vest in me by the villag elder of tavuki and somosomo i samuela vagoni have the author to request from you the sum of five fijian dollar £185 to pass thi point and ascend to see the tagimoucia

i just charg them 10 fijian dollar on the way down
he said with a grinvillag elder recommend hire a guid for anyon tri to see the tagimoucia credit ben mckechnievagoni also told me that i'd be foolish to ascend the mountain without a guid
the first threequart of the way up you'll be on the steep servic road to the de voeux phone tower but then you must cut into the rainforest on an unmark track to have ani chanc of find the tagimoucia
there' thick fog and it' alway rain he said
at best you don't find the flower
at worst you get complet lost and we have to send polic and a villag search parti
i ask vagoni whether thi worstcas scenario ha happen befor

after 30 minut he point up at the canopi excitedli
look

he shout
i couldn't believ we'd found it – i also couldn't see a thing as my glass were complet steam up
i ask whether there wa a way to hook the vine down to look at the flower up close without cut it
talemaivesi oblig and i final had a peek at thi rarest and most elus of flowersmitchel wa right the tagimoucia is small like the tip of an adult' thumb
i examin the flower' two distinct part – a crimson outer shell from which a white flower with a purpl crown and yellow filament burst as if it wa tri to escap
then i went in for a sniff but wa surpris to find that the tagimoucia ha almost no scent whatsoev
and as i gaze at it i realis the journey to get to thi incred remot spot had been as excit as find the flower itselfaft a sudden downpour we squelch back the way we came
the rain continu for hour all the way down the mountain and by the time i made it back to somosomo where the tikoilawaqa and mitchel were wait i look like a drown ratloc say it alway rain along the trail to see the tagimoucia credit horizon intern imagesalamyfind the tagimoucia on ani attempt is far from a given so the famili were thrill to see my pictur

the acid of the lime and sweet of the coconut balanc the earthi bitter of the crab and i felt my energi be restoreda i flew back to suva two day later i glimps down and saw the servic road peak and rainforest where i had trek just two day ago
i thought back to someth that mitchel said to me over a plate of crispi fri breadfruit
when i told her that i couldn't detect ani scent to the tagimoucia flower she laugh and said oh you'r half right i suppos
the tagimoucia doe have a smell though – a strong beauti one
it' just not here on taveuni
see my perplex look she explain her version of the famou legend
we'r from qamea where the tagimoucia is origin from
hundr of year ago our tribe' chief gave the flower as a gift of peac to the somosomo tribe
thi is how it came to taveuni
but the smell did not go with it
even today the scent linger there on our island qamea
it' especi strong in the even
some say the scent of tagimoucia linger on qamea credit wirestock incalamymitchel took a swig of hot lemongrass tea and continu

i rememb think perhap thi is the time the somosomo girl and the qamea warrior use to meet
on taveuni i sens the boundari of histori legend and fantasi tend to blur

travel,"autumn leav crackl under our shoe as dozen of eager tourist and i follow a guid along a grassi mound
we stop when we reach the open of a turftop circl which wa form by anoth wall of mound earth
we were at the octagon part of the hopewel ceremoni earthwork a larg network of handconstruct hill spread throughout central and southern ohio that were built as mani as 2000 year ago
indigen peopl would come to the octagon from hundr of mile away gather regularli for share ritual and worship
there wa a sweat lodg or some kind of purif place there said our guid brad lepper the senior archaeologist for the ohio histori connection' world heritag program ohc as he point to the circl

a tall flag mark a hole at it centr
the octagon is current be use as a golf courseth hopewel cultur creat massiv mysteri earthwork across ohio credit mari salengetti imagesal of these all these prehistor ceremoni earthwork in ohio were creat by what is now call the hopewel cultur a network of nativ american societi that gather from as far away as montana and the gulf of mexico between roughli 100 bce and 500 ce and were connect by a seri of trade rout
their earthwork in ohio consist of shape – like circl squar and octagon – that were often connect to each other
archaeologist are onli now begin to understand the sophist of these engin marvel
built with astonish mathemat precis as well as a complex astronom align these are the largest geometr earthwork in the world that were not built as fortif or defens structur
and while most peopl have never heard about the site or it builder that may be about to changeth us depart of the interior ha nomin eight of hopewell' earthwork for consider in 2023 as a unesco world heritag site
these includ the great circl and the octagon in newark ohio as well ohio' first state park fort ancient not an actual fort
the other five are part of the hopewel cultur nation histor park mound citi hopeton earthwork high bank work hopewel mound group and seip earthwork
lepper told me the octagon and the great circl were onc a larger singl hopewel complex span 45 sq mile and connect by a seri of road line by earthwork wall
walk through both site today there is an immedi shock of scale
the great circl where the museum for hopewel ceremoni earthwork is found is 1200ft in diamet
it wall rise up to 14ft high and are outlin on the insid by a deep ditch
the great circl wa onc connect to a squar and a burial ellips with onli part of the squar still visibl today
the octagon sprawl a massiv 50 acr and is attach to the 20acr observatori circl a larg earthwork circl for gather and ritual connect to the observ of the night skyth earthworks' sophist ha astonish historian credit ohio histori connectiony could put four roman colosseum insid just the octagon lepper told me
stoneheng would fit within just that small circl now serv as a put green
he ad that 2000 year ago indigen worker built these earthwork without modern tool dig up soil with point stick and haul it in wicker basket on their back
one estim he note is that they move seven million cubic feet of dirt
the achiev of the hopewel cultur howev is not simpli in creat larg precis shape which they did without the vantag point of hill for an aerial view
they also embed a sort of hidden geometri within these structur
until the mound were measur and compar it wa thought that the builder didn't have ani mathemat and geometr sophist as there are no written record to testifi to their level of knowledg
it wa eventu discov howev that they made precis measur across their earthwork and connect them in unsuspect way
lepper explain that the circumfer of the great circl is equal to the perimet of the perfect squar that it wa connect to and that the area of that perfect squar is equal to the area of the observatori circl that' connect to the octagon
he ad if you draw a squar insid the octagon by draw a line from altern corner of the octagon the side of that squar 1054ft are equal to the diamet of the circl that it' attach to 1054ft
exampl of the hopewel culture' monument earthwork have been found all over ohio includ at the miamisburg mound credit gari whittonalamyexampl of thi interplay between earthwork have been found repeatedli by archaeologist
accord to lepper that measur of 1054ft whether halv or doubl is found in other indigen earthwork across the countri and serv as a common unit of measur
while the hopewel culture' geometr and mathemat knowledg astonish scholar anoth level of sophist appear when the layer are peel back further astronom align
in the 1980 two professor at earlham colleg in indiana ray hive a physicist and astronom and robert horn a philosoph decid to pay a visit to the octagon and it attach observatori circl
as astronom monument like stoneheng had receiv great attent they wonder if these earthwork were also align to a solar calendar
hive and horn found no solar connect but they then consid an altern purpos the lunar cyclein the 1800 white settler began build their home around the area where the earthwork were built credit quagga mediaalamyw thought deliber lunar align unlik at newark they wrote becaus while the sun can be track over a year a complet lunar cycl take 186 year
even so the lunar cycl prove to correspond to the posit of the observatori mound at the observatori circl
there one can watch the moon rise over the exact centr of the octagon in the distanc everi 186 year
astronom align are onli relev and use if they somehow tie the celesti orb to belief system and understand of life said timothi darvil professor of archaeolog at bournemouth univers who ha research both stoneheng and the hopewel ceremoni earthwork
the ceremoni around the observ of the skyscap could well have a secondari function in term of foster commun
that ancient commun and cultur is part of the case be made to unesco
a unesco site need to show that it ha outstand univers valu said jennif aultman director of histor site and museum at ohio histori connect and the ohio lead for unesco consider
one criterion for thi she said is that these are masterpiec of human creativ geniu which is where these mathemat geometr and astronom featur are import
the other is that they bear realli except testimoni to the cultur tradit that produc themin recent year the area near the octagon ha been use as a golf cours credit brandon withrowaultman explain you realli can understand someth about the live of the peopl and what matter to them by look at and learn about the earthwork
consid the moon for exampl which wa clearli import for the hopewel cultur
darvil told me that for some cultur the sun moon are consid to have power over what happen on a daytoday basi
as such the heavenli bodi are often deifi which is how their power is justifi and rationalis
it is therefor like that the moon wa a deiti share by those who gather at the mound
the land we know as ohio is home to a number of extraordinari earthwork built by indigen resid of thi region thousand of year ago said megan wood execut director and ceo of the ohio histori connect
while not all earthwork in ohio are specif hopewel mound – such as the solaralign serpent mound histor site in peebl ohio for exampl – wood see them all as icon of indigen cultur achiev
sinc the hopewel cultur left no written record onli the earthwork and the few object retriev from them serv as their last cultur testimoni
while archaeolog excav continu on some site object like ritual smoke pipe and a small stone statu of a shaman wear a bear skin and hold a human skull call the shaman of newark have been found
as these earthwork were gather place and not villag artefact repres the locat from where these indigen peopl travel have also been discov like effigi pipe a copper head plate and an obsidian knifebecaus they left no written record the hopewel remain someth of a mysteri to anthropologist credit caleb hughesalamyhowev after the hopewel cultur gradual began to disappear start around 500 ce other indigen peopl step in to becom caretak of the land
one of those group wa the shawne tribe which call ohio home befor they were forcibl remov west of the mississippi river in the 1830
we may not have been respons for build or creat them but i know that my ancestor live there and that my ancestor protect them and respect them said chief glenna wallac of the eastern shawne tribe of oklahoma who believ that other tribe should have a role in the futur of protect the hopewel earthwork and commun their cultur import
howev receiv unesco statu is a difficult bureaucrat process
while sit on land own by the ohc the octagon is under the control of the moundbuild countri club
the club negoti an unpreced leas that extend until 2078 and onli allow visitor to walk the mound four time a year
the rest of the time visitor can access a platform in the car park to view a veri small section of the properti
ohc is current su to evict the countri club with compens through emin domain
the lower court rule in favour of the histor societi but the ohio suprem court is hear an appeal
if ohc can't guarante public access thi may impact unesco' decisiona small public view platform allow visitor to see the mound across the golf cours credit brandon withrowwhil a unesco design wouldn't entail the return of land or repar it doe mean greater local represent and educ about ohio' nativ american histori
it also mean more indigen stakehold like the shawne tell that stori from an indigen perspect for futur gener
i just want peopl to know about it said chief wallac i want peopl to be abl to see it

thi meant spend more time on russian languag lesson than lithuanian and rid societi of it intellectu – appli the same approach to lithuanian literatur cultur religion and gastronomi
there wa a onecuisin approach for our entir region without variat keršulytėryčkova said
there wa a list of dish that were made in all restaur and cafe and you could not do anyth out of the list
keršulytėryčkova said that a typic soviet menu might includ chicken kyiv chicken fillet pound roll in butter and coat with egg and breadcrumb shashlik meat skewer meatbal made from pork goulash and borschttwo or three gener of gastronom knowledg were lost by the time lithuania gain independ from the soviet union on 11 march 1990

but chef like keršulytėryčkova are resurrect it creat menu that tell a nation stori mani lithuanian themselv aren't familiar withbut where doe thi stori beginin lithuania there' a commun of romuva who continu to practic their ancient tradit
they'r some of the first who can recognis the ancient root behind how mani lithuanian eat and drink todayin lithuania romuva is make a comeback with approxim 10000 member and an ongo fight for state recognitionugniu liogė who organ the community' annual mėnuo juodaragi festiv met me with igna šatkauska a romuva priest at the snowcov stone altar of raguti the beer god of lithuania' ancient faith

for mani lithuanian histori buff thi bit of histor trivia is seen as a kind of humbl brag that lithuania held onto their nativ tradit longer than other in europ
armenia wa the first nation in the world to adopt christian in 301 ce follow by variou european kingdom between the 4th and 12th centuri
ultim howev christian becam the domin faith but eat and drink habit born from thi ancient tradit have remain even if mani lithuanian don't know it

although thi practic wa offici forbidden dure the soviet occup cathol famili continu to observ the tradit in secretlithuanian historian andželika laužikienė explain some of the specif rule and tradit tie to kūčio
for exampl there are 12 dish that repres the 12 apostl
these contain no meat milk product or egg becaus it' a strict fast period
one ha to tast at least a piec of everi dish she said for prosper in the next year
laužikienė ad that lithuanian draw straw of hay from underneath a piec of cloth to see if they'r go to live long – a tradit with strong root in the romuva faiththen there' raguoli a tradit lithuanian tree cake serv on special occas particularli christian holiday like christma eve and easter

you'd never know where they came from by observ with the nake eye given the way they'r constantli recycl and take new form
nevertheless they remainnon of thi is to say that all of lithuania' culinari heritag stem from ancient or mediev time
there were centuri between the christianis of the countri and soviet occup
and with that period of rel freedom there' plenti for contemporari chef to rediscov
accord to keršulytėryčkova' research lithuanianwritten recip did not exist befor the 19th centuri
and thu she work with histor refer to dish and ingredi found in archiv and old book recreat them base sole on their descript
we work with the lithuanian histori institut and we look into the inventori of differ palac she said
so you have ingredi list for each centuri for each period for each duke
it wa a busi tuesday night when keršulytėryčkova led me down the spiral stone staircas into the 16thcenturi gothic cellar where an entir portion of the menu featur wild game with caption referenc the historywild boar for exampl wa a privileg reserv for lithuanian nobl

loki promis a recreat of histor lithuanian cuisin and he couldn't find ani represent of hi ancestor
keršulytė call the interact an eyeopen move experi
she admit her mistak and promis him that the next time he came she would have a dish on the menu that repres hi historywhil not make excus keršulytėryčkova explain that thi too is common in lithuania
the guilt of the holocaust she surmis is probabl whi
we miss a big part of lithuanian histori becaus in lithuania we do not talk about our jewish commun that use to live here she explain
we know it but it' not a subject we touch a lot commonli
to fill the litvak gap she refer larg to vilnius' own fania lewando who wrote the vilna vegetarian first publish in yiddish in 1938 and rediscov and translat into english in 2015
the kosher cater and author champion vegetarian cuisin long befor it wa en vogu and climat chang demand a tougher look at our eat norm

the kneidlach matzo ball came to her from nida degutiene' recip in a tast of israelth term potato dumpl is a catchal english translat of a wide varieti of potato dish in european cuisin
in vilniu it'll get you a cepelinai or zeppelin – larg dumpl made from grate raw potato and shape by hand into the round cylind shape of a zeppelin
they'r more glutin than gnocchi and a closer cousin to the german or austrian kartoffel knödel

keršulytėryčkova said thi is how cepelinai enter and becam the showpiec of lithuania' culinari canon

nonjewish lithuanian mere adapt it by ad porkmost lithuanian would point to cepelinai as one of the stapl of their cuisin along with other potatorich dish like kuge – ovenbak grate potato mix with onion milk egg salt pepper and bacon
but keršulytėryčkova said they'r actual from vilnius' histor litvak commun date to the begin of the 17th centuri
it' a veri funni thing becaus if you ask ani lithuanian on the street he will swear that it' 100 lithuanian and that it ha noth to do with the jewish commun she said
but it did come from their litvak cuisin to us

travel,"the road to kjeåsen a mountain farm deep in western norway' fjord countri look like a rout to nowherehug the shorelin of simadalfjord a tini arm of hardangerfjord the road wander from the villag of eidfjord past wooden watersid cabin and oxbloodr farm build
it rare see ani traffic which is just as well becaus the margin for error is measur in inch one laps in concentr and you'll be in the waterup ahead the outlook for a road trip is not promis
sheer rock wall so steep that they keep the valley floor in shadow for month everi year close the simadalen valley off from the rest of the world on three side
where the fjord end the road pass through forest of pine and spruce cross a rush stream fed by waterfal and then arriv at a fork
turn right and the road soon peter out in the forest it onward path block by rock wall hundr of metr high
turn left in the direct of kjeåsen and the journey seem equal unpromis for want of ani obviou way forwardi am travel thi road becaus my destin is no ordinari place
kjeåsen sit 600 vertic metr abov simadalfjord and it small collect of farm build is famou throughout norway as one of the most isol inhabit corner of the countri
for most of it long histori there wasn't even a road up to where it sit perch on a narrow grassi ledg hidden from the outsid world but in thrall of one of the country' most spectacular viewsit wa onli in 1975 that the farm wa connect by road to the rest of the world nearli 600m below credit heidi kvamsdalback then it wa one of the most difficult most beauti place to reach anywher in norway
to get to kjeåsen involv a peril twohour climb use rope ladder and rope bridg across a landscap slicken with ice
there were onc as mani as 13 children at kjeåsen and their daili commut to the school in simad wa a danger fourhour round trip
access wa so difficult that one of the build still extant at kjeåsen took 30 year to build back at the end of the 19th centuri becaus suppli had to be carri up the danger mountain trail on the back of the buildersto have live there by choic cut off from the world must have been a consciou act of escap or of solitud
from where i am down below where kjeåsen is just a name on a road sign it' imposs to imagin
in fact it' easi to wonder whether kjeåsen exist at allther are mani theori about the first peopl to settl here
one is that it wa a soldier who desert from the swedish armi said heidi kvamsdal a photograph local historian and eidfjord nativ
anoth theori is that the first one tri to escap from the black death in the 14th centuri
in it aftermath said kvamsdal peopl abandon kjeåsen for more than 150 year
but we know that there ha been perman settlement there sinc earli 16th centuri
news of kjeåsen first reach a fascin outsid world in the 1950 when swedish writer bror ekström visit and wrote a book call folket på kjeåsen peopl of kjeåsen
the book told the stori of a farm commun uniqu and tini of a world unto itself of mountain famili cut off from the outsid world yet somehow surviv against the element
it wa a stori that juxtapos inaccess with miracul beauti
and their stori of isol and resili captur the public' imaginationth farm complex is now empti for most of the year with the last perman resid leav in 2019 credit adoni villanuevaalamyin 1967 a woman name bjørg wiik move to kjeåsen to help her aunt look after the farm and she wa join by her sister guri in 1975 when their aunt pass away
the two sister formerli from oslo live here alon until guri' death in 1999
bjørg live here yearround until 2019 when she wa in her 90 and she still return with famili member to pass the summerth 8km access road wa not finish until 1975
but the road did noth to diminish kjeåsen' mystiqu
instead it wa like an open invit for the curiou
elin kvale a local guid who arriv in eidfjord in 1975 when her husband work on the road' construct would later take the first tourist to kjeåsen
she rememb how all kind of peopl came some in wheelchair some veri old even peopl who were blind
they all had a common goal they need to visit thi place
most of the peopl had read the book some sever time
they felt like they were walk on holi ground
despit the road guri and bjørg never learn how to drive – they prefer to walk or if they need suppli they ask friend down in the valley to come up
in ani case even a road wa no match for the depth of a norwegian winter
as recent as 1994 the sister were cut off from the outsid world for more than a month by 3mdeep snow
provid they had plan care and stockpil suffici suppli the snow were less of a problem than the strong ici wind that can rage at these altitud to thi day the roof of all the farm build here are held in place by anchor steel cabl
and on one occas when the sister fell ill with influenza while cut off by snow a helicopt had to airdrop medicin and food to the stricken inhabitantsdu to the narrow of the road vehicl may onli travel in each direct onc an hour credit heidi kvamsdalautumn wa alway bjørg' favourit season at kjeåsen say kvale and when i begin my own drive up here on a cold and cloudi novemb morn the road appear desert
but befor i begin i have to wait
the road is so narrow that a oneway system oper car drive up to kjeåsen must do so on the hour those descend leav half an hour latera the clock tick over with not anoth vehicl in sight i turn onto the kjeåsen road and begin to climb
beneath tower cliff the road cut a sinuou path hairpin bend after hairpin bend switchback after switchback gain altitud all the while
thi part of the road is onli 25km long but alreadi the valley is far down belowup abov there is suddenli nowher for the road to go and so it plung into a tunnel hewn roughli from the rock climb through the inner chamber of the mountain
the tunnel is just 25km long but it seem longer due to the knowledg that thi dark corridor through a mountain is all that connect kjeåsen to the outsid worlda i emerg into the light it take a few moment for my eye to adjust
cloud swirl through the treetop
a mountain river thunder down off great boulder
there are no sign of lifekjeåsen becam famou in the 1950 due to a book call folket på kjeåsen credit visit hardangerfjordkjeåsen' tight gather of wooden hut with stone foundat is as desert as the road
abov the hut the hillsid climb steepli into the cloud forest
down below narrow grassi field where bjørg and her sister kept sheep and grew some of their own food drop steepli down to a shelf from where… the viewfor a moment the cloud part and a nearperfect tableau of norway' fjord countri extend out across water turn turquois in the sunshin
imposs steep rock wall rise into the snow and there is a distant glimps of eidfjord
for a moment i wish that i could live up here on the height of kjeåsen and sit for hour on end to gaze with wonder upon thi one of the most beauti view in norwayand then the cloud close in again as they often do outsid the short summer window
the view is gone and i am alon here cut off from world which suddenli feel a veri long way away
i shudder
but there is a wild charm to the isol a delici sensat of be beyond the world and it nois and have thi special place all to myselffor the first time i understand that for those who live here the isol wa never the enemi and wa onli rare an inconveni
in fact remot wa the whole point a preciou way of life that depend on a close to natur and seclus from the wider world
most of the winter were just good day said kvale who knew the wiik sister well
they care for the sheep and for all the bird and other wild anim
in winter bad weather can cut off the farm for week at a time credit anthoni hamand in summer their live were the envi of those down below by the fjord in eidfjord the soil wa not so fertil and the sun stay away for month at a time said kvale
kjeåsen ha the sun whole year the soil is more fertil and it wa much closer to the reindeer
that wa essenti to their life support as wa the fish in the mountain lake
it wa bjørg onc told kvale easi to dream while sit outsid the hous on a nice sunni day in autumn
the air is so crystal clear
complet peac
on her frequent visit to spend time with bjørg in her home kvale rememb there wa a veri special atmospher of calm and peac
about onc a year bjørg visit her childhood home in oslo
but after a few day she long to return to the peac and good life at kjeåsen

travel,"the palac look like a mirag of itself
water from the canal shimmer under the sun direct my gaze toward it
the opul build command the landscap and the landscap seem made for it
i hop on my bike
beam of light strobe through narrow crack between the tree and my tyre crush the gravel
as i cycl along a hidden path crimson tree leav canopi overhead and open field sprawl into the distanc
there wa no one in sight
but just a short distanc away insid the palac of versailles' opul ballroom thousand of peopl swarmedi wa at the park of versail the 800hectar playground for the king queen and polit leader who made up france' prerevolutionari rule class
versail wa the centr of power and the materi embodi of absolut monarchi that reign over franc until the revolut from 17881799
the palac bore wit to strateg marriag and state visit
but the whole estat wa realli construct for anoth reason leisur with the sweep park and smaller manicur garden use for pleasur – and debaucheryth park of versail is a sweep oasi that is free to the public most day credit lili radziemskiin the centuri sinc it wa built versail ha becom one of the most famou and visit palac in the world – a site that see 27000 visitor and their selfi stick cram into it hall of mirror everi day
but outsid the palac there' anoth stori a sprawl one that extend for kilometr and is nearli imposs to cover by foot in a day
that' where the bike path come in line the way to fresh air solitud and a side to loui xiv' grand vision that few visitor grasp
when you go to the garden you'r cycl and you get to know more of the stori of loui xiv xv and xvi mara alfaro pria a parisbas tour guid told me over the phone
it' not just what wa behind the paint or the chandeli
it all start in 1623 when loui xiii built a hunt lodg in the roll countrysid around the small town of versail about 20km southwest of central pari
but hi son loui xiv had bigger plan for the ground
loui xiv wa a bit of an architect explain mathieu da vinha the scientif director of the research centr of the palac of versail
in pari he couldn't realli enlarg the palac becaus the urban tissu wa too dense… in versail it wa the contrari
loui xiv want an opul bachelor pad where he could parti with hi royal pal credit lili radziemskibut the king didn't just want more space
loui xiv need what we would call today a 'bachelor pad' – that is to say a small hous of pleasures… for fun parti with some friend said michel vergéfranceschi coauthor of the book une histoir érotiqu de versail
so he'll creat versail partial for hi pleasur for hi sexual with amaz garden
near the top of the park' grand canal tuck away between cafe and restaur there' a stand where visitor can hire bike
in recent year i'v made bike in versail my primari freshair escap from my home in pari a friend use to bike all the way from pari to versail and inspir me but i had never ventur much beyond the canal
so thi autumn i stroll through the garden on my way down to the bike stand walk past the latona fountain kick up orangehu leav fallen from sculpt tree
i want to discov more about the garden overflow with flower and romant grovesthi wa the vision of andré le nôtre the garden to the kingon of the best way to explor the ground is by hire a bike credit lili radziemskiit' a garden where noth is left to chanc hélène dalifard the palace' commun director told me
the gaze is alway guid toward a particular effect… the idea is realli to imagin the garden as a museum in which the visitor think they'r take a random stroll while in realiti they'r complet guid by the effect of perspect
the dimens of versail and it park were care calcul to mirror the louvr the etoil royal the vantag point at the far end of the canal and the fountain of apollo are the exact same distanc apart as the place de l'êtoil and the place de la concord in pari
and the distanc between the fountain of apollo and the versail palac is the same as the distanc from place de la concord to the louvr
there are optic illus hidden grove and subtl messag allud to the sun throughout the park
when he becam king loui xiv chose the sun as hi person symbol and becam known as the sun king
to reinforc that connect the imag of apollo the greek god of the sun appear in fountain grove and statu throughout the park
symbol versail would revolv around him and the garden were hi stage
versail wa the king' theatr vergéfranceschi said ad that loui xiv even wrote a book about the correct way to visit the garden
the rout start from the top step of the garden read almost as a howto manual with precis direct on where to walk paus and what to admir along the wayloui xiv even wrote a guidebook about how to best visit hi garden credit christoph coatalamyth bike path are frame by tree stretch overhead
dirt trail unlock a whole other network of grassi expans as the path gave way to apollo' fountain
as i cycl it felt like be in the middl of nowher despit the palac be one of the most visit place on earth
in 1661 when loui xiv wa marri to maria theresa of austria he met louis de la vallièr the woman that would becom hi first offici mistress
she would go horseback ride in the park… she could stand on a hors by hold the rein of the anim with silk cord and she could kill a wild boar in the forest of versail with stake vergéfranceschi said
they met in privat in loui xiii' hunt lodg in the park
the parti of the delight of the enchant island a legendari blowout that stretch on for multipl day in the park and garden wa offici to honour loui xiv' mother and wife
unoffici it wa dedic to louis de la vallièr
there were carousel firework and perform by renown french playwright molièrean estim 27000 visitor and their selfi stick cram into versailles' hall of mirror everi day credit stockbymalamysinc the chateau wa too small befor loui xiv enlarg it the parti mostli took place in the garden da vinha said
the park ha an air of excess and exclus but surprisingli the ground were tradit never close to the public
the entir complex remain open from the king' bedroom as long as he wasn't there to the garden and the park
today versail still alway remain open to the public and access to the garden and park is free except dure select day
the tradit of the french monarchi is that the king should be access by hi subject so one could enter into the chateau pretti freeli under the condit of be welldress da vinha explain
the lack of privaci could have been a contribut factor to the expans of the ground
in versail one palac just wasn't enoughth grand trianon is just a fiveminut pedal from the bike stand credit lili radziemskiloui xiv want an escap from hi escap and commiss the grand trianon on the northern end of the grand canal in 1670
thi wa where he spent time with madam de montespan the mistress who follow louis de la vallièreit' a 30minut walk from the palac to the site but a bike path cut directli to it in a fiveminut ride from the rental stand
the gravel rout travel between the grand trianon and the canal wrap around the water
the structur sit on an elev piec of land it salmonpink marbl wall bend into archway open to the landscap
it' breezi and pretti like a littl jewel box born out of nowher
when i went toward the end of the day there were few other roam through it roomsa short pedal away from the grand trianon lie the petit trianon a palac loui xv commiss for the comptess du barri in 1758 hi mistress at the time it wa suppos to be for madam de pompadour but she die befor it complet
it would eventu be offer to marieantoinett as a gift from loui xvi in 1774
she spent most of her time there
the isol of the monarchi at versail play a role in the revolut they continu to live in opul while the french popul wa starv and hundr of citizen ultim storm the ground in 1789
versail contribut to loui xvi and marieantoinett be disconnect from realiti vergéfranceschi saidtoday the palac and park are part of the republ credit onli francealamya few year after the revolut the palac and it garden were absorb by the republ to be conserv for the publici drop off my bike and left the park at sunset

occasion i heard a donkey honk or church bell clatter but otherwis silenc reignedth town also felt veri human in scale
walk up the maze of narrow street and alley to get a view over the harbour i frequent saw group of friend and neighbour greet one anoth chat and gossip in the middl of the road
one even a group of kid ran past my tabl as i drank a beer by the port bash each other with balloon their parent with no anxieti about traffic
even the countless stray cat a familiar featur of greek island seem unusu relax – often sprawl out lazili in the middl of thoroughfaresi'm hardli the first outsid to be enchant by hydra which ha a long histori of tourism and ha also attract a bohemian set
canadian songwrit leonard cohen famous bought a hous here in the 1960 and pen bird on a wire dure one of hi stay

how doe a place work in the modern world without wheel transport
we regularli catch fire said kelsey edward an englishwoman who' live on hydra for more than 20 year and run hydradirect a local inform and properti websit

edward explain that sinc much of the island is inaccess due it lack of road the local firefight volunt group are unabl to put out conflagr on their own
even when blaze break out near hydra town itself which is the onli signific popul centr everyon ha to run and manual carri up water to put the fire outand fire aren't the onli time where a lack of vehicl is a hindranc
we can't just dial emerg servic and get an ambul edward continu
she said that when peopl have health emerg get to the town' small medic centr can be veri difficult especi for those who live higher up the steep side of the hill

hydra is also much wealthier than other island in the saron archipelago to which it belong edward said

they resembl larg green lemon have more peel than pulp and with a sourbitt flavour they are not consid desir for home consumpt
thi mean that outsid of calabria you won't typic find them at the supermarketbut accord to the torah the etrog hebrew for citron is the fruit of the most beauti tree possibl even the forbidden fruit of the garden of eden
and although there are multipl citron varieti around the world one jewish commun believ that the calabrian one known as liscio diamant is the purest and most perfect of alleach summer hasid rabbi travel to calabria to select the best citron for the jewish holiday of sukkot credit alberto pizzoliafpgetti imagesth citron plant citru medica arriv in thi region around 2000 year ago follow jewish migrat

the contrast of mountain and sea is one of the area' most distinct featureswhen i drove to calabria from northern itali i wa struck by the fact that in some place such as the town of san nicola arcella the mountain on my left extend all the way to the sea on my right to form scenic cliff sea cave and arch
these impos mountain which are part of the pollino nation park are a popular destin for hiker and rafter and are home to rare anim and plant speci

worklife,"the idea of a fourday workweek use to be such a pipedream that it wa bare on the radar for most worker and firm
but in the wake of the covid19 pandem mani compani around the world have given thi thi setup a go – and gather promis resultsin the us and ireland a sixmonth trial among 33 volunt compani in 2022 show a posit impact on compani perform product and employe wellb
employe work the shorten week report less stress and fatigu plu improv worklif balanc and satisfact
the 27 compani that submit a final survey rate the trial a nine out of 10in a 2022 uk trial of 70 firm 86 of compani said the fourday week wa such a success they plan to keep it in place after the pilot end
they cite benefit such as increas product and signific financi save for employe on transport and childcar
similar trial in belgium spain japan australia and new zealand have thrown up equal promis result for compani
and – unsurprisingli – employe seem especi keen to make shorter work week the normyet despit the overwhelmingli posit data a fourday workweek still seem out of reach for mani worker
tech worker in agil forwardthink compani might hope for such a benefit in the near futur but it is harder to envisag the same chang for schoolteach or offic worker in more tradit compani
ultim some industri and deepli entrench work cultur mean the fourday workweek may not be realist for all employe – at least for nowfind the right fittechnolog and officebas industri have made the greatest inroad into reduc work hour so far
“it is realli take off as a notabl trend in area like tech softwar ict internet commun technolog financ and profession servic – knowledgebas role that use to be primarili officebas but are now in mani case are hybrid or remote” say joe o’connor director and cofound of the work time reduct center of excel base in toronto
while a mindset of agil and innov is often bake into such compani they also have an advantag in term of easi timesav solut
measur such as introduc meetingfre day can enabl employe to focu pure on product and radic reduc work hour while concurr maintain output – someth far easier to do in nimbl organisationsin other sector shorten the work week is possibl but requir rethink longestablish norm
consult and law for instanc are often organis around the concept of the billabl hour – mean less work automat equal less incom
but such cultur can chang believ o’connor “we'r start to see exampl of law firm move to fourday week by switch from bill by the hour to bill by project valu or by reduc their nonbil overhead so that their team are more focus on client work” the viabil of thi shorten workweek for compani in these lessflex industri may also look differ than what other more nimbl firm and sector are abl to dofor instanc “if these firm close on friday and give everyon the same day off that make coordin with client supplier and the rest of the economi harder” say pedro gome author of friday is the new saturday and coordin of an upcom portugues govern trial of the fourday workweek
“the altern is to give differ peopl differ day off so you maintain work five day but then you need commun process in team to be abl to deal with day when colleagu are not there” as such while collabor workplac like advertis agenc might choos for all employe to take the same day off to better enabl team coordin industri that reli on trade throughout the week like hospit and servic may establish process for salari nonshift worker to take off differ day
in thi way mani expert believ the fourday workweek can adapt to suit most industri
“we have seen veri success exampl everywhere” add o’connor “from nonprofit to manufactur compani to even hospitality”som expert believ there are industri such as manufactur that may have a more difficult time pivot to a shorten workweek credit getti imagesentrench cultur in the current workplac some import predictor of whether an organis is like to success implement a shorter work week may be compani size and cultur
so far few major intern compani have run trial of the fourday workweekdespit posit result from a trial by microsoft in japan and unilev in new zealand other major corpor have been slow to follow suit
“larg compani have the financi capac to make the chang but much more rigid structures” say gome
“in practic what we see is more small and medium compani triall the fourday workweek becaus they are more agil and they usual have a ceo or a founder that ha a veri good pictur of how it would impact the whole business”in other word leader of smaller firm may have less red tape to deal with and find it easier to forecast how widespread chang will impact the compani overal than leader in sprawl global organis with more labyrinthian layer structur
but in compani of all size a certain type of manag could also be resist chang entrench norm – a signific barrier to the implant of shorter week
although the global movement in support of the fourday week is gather pace it is not yet a mainstream work practic and undertak such progress chang requir a high level of trust between leader and worker
if manag don't trust that employe can make a success of the chang they are unlik to want to even test it
notabl productivityrel trust issu have been a major problem for manag throughout the pandem
“the biggest barrier to compani introduc fourday workweek is like a combin of entrench cultur and resist bosses” say benjamin laker professor at henley busi school in read uk
“some manag may view the shorter workweek as reduc their control or make it more difficult to manag employees” in other word riskavers manag might question whi they would shake up a system that’ alreadi workingin case where fourday workweek have proven unpopular among employe a common issu ha been report of manag intensifi perform measur monitor and product pressur
so although mani worker cite better wellb in some area the result of these ad element can spike worker stress level
“if an organis cultur doesn't have that trust but instead ha a veri top down centralis decisionmak structur they would probabl struggl to make thi work” add o’connoroth organis for which fourday workweek are like off the tabl are hourli and servicebas – like restaur retail and healthcar – where a shorter workweek and subsequ fewer shift ultim mean lower compens
although worker in these industri would like experi similar benefit from reduc workload creat a pathway to less labour may be imposs if it mean lose out on payth new normaleven face resist from some leader expert say it is like the fourday week will becom more mainstream
in sector that are alreadi welcom the shift the 32hour week is emerg as “a as a tool for competit advantag in term of talent attract and retention” say o’connor

worklife,"warn thi stori includ detail of traumat birth that some reader may find distressingwhen emma carr fell pregnant in 2021 she had a vision for her ideal birth
at the most basic level she want to feel empow listen to and in control
but like mani women carr’ vision went further than that
in particular she hope for a 'natur birth' – gener describ as a vagin deliveri with as littl medic intervent and pharmacolog pain relief as possiblesh follow two cours includ one popular approach known as 'hypnobirthing' which taught relax and breath to help eas pain and help stay present dure deliveri
and as her instructor recommend she watch video of healthi happi nontraumat birth to get her into the right mindset
you watch all these video of these babi be born and it' so beauti say carr 36 who live in london
“they come out realli easili and the woman grab them and you'r just like 'that' what'll happen to me'
but when carr' water broke the fluid contain meconium – the foetus' stool which can be danger for mother and child
after she rush to hospit doctor told her they had to get the babi out immedi
two hour later she lay on the oper tabl under bright light
far from her ideal interventionfre vagin birth her babi wa born by caesarean section
worst of all she say wa how unprepar she felt for thi kind of outcom given how focus she had been – and had been encourag to be in the cours she follow – on creat a posit mindset
if i hadn't had in my head how it 'should' have gone then i wouldn't feel like it wa a failur she say
i just wish my instructor were a bit more open about how these birth happen
that it doesn't alway go right just becaus you did hypnobirth
while she wa pregnant carr say friend tri to warn her she might not have the labour she wa hope for
but she dismiss them think they probabl hadn't gone in with the mindset or techniqu she would
peopl that you would normal listen to you stop listen to becaus you'v got these other peopl in your head tell you birth should be natur and magic and that your bodi is just perfectli design to do it she say
but i don't think mine wa
mani women do benefit from thi approach to birth
some even experi the ideal scenario that they hope for
with the right techniqu – like breath listen to affirm or massag – some advoc say birth can be enjoy even orgasm
but other like carr are left reel and not onli from a traumat birth – they feel as if have been fixat on that vision and not prepar for the mani way in which it might not happen made their experi even worsebirth of a movementfor much of histori women frequent die in labour – as often as in one in everi 100 birth in the 1600 and 1700
scientif advanc includ antibiot mean that the matern mortal rate ha plummet
as the medic commun expand it focu beyond safeti narcot pain reduct techniqu like the epidur becam common in mani countri
even today matern mortal is highest in countri where there might not be adequ medic care for complic more easili treat elsewhereaft prepar themselv for an 'ideal' birth experi some women feel as if they'v fail if they end up have medic intervent like csection credit getti imagesmani birth parent choos modern painmanag as the right choic for them and mani doctor also recommend it
but other women and health practition believ the birth process ha gone too far in thi direct say that an overreli on medic intervent can be unnecessari riski even dehumanis
in the 1960 for exampl women in wealthi countri often gave birth while sedat with gener anaesthesia
they may not have felt pain but they couldn't feel present or make inthemo decis regard their care either
today mani women now strive for – and idealis – what is often refer to as a 'posit birth'
coin by uk birth campaign and posit birth movement founder milli hill the term 'posit birth' wasn't origin meant to describ ani particular kind of labour
it ha broaden
a posit birth doe not have to be 'natural' or 'drug free' – it simpli ha to be inform from a place of posit as oppos to fear the association' websit read
you can birth with posit in hospit or at home with or without medic intervent
rather the websit outlin it is an experi where a woman feel she ha freedom of choic access to accur inform and that she is in control power and respect as well as one that she goe on to enjoy and later rememb with warmth and pride
still mani women who follow posit birth cours say they feel an undercurr of idealis 'natural' birth in particular
for some instructor a big part in emphasis how birth can be 'positive' come with talk about how a woman' bodi is 'designed' to give birth – and the subtext can be that medic intervent imped rather than assist thi processa main tenet of mani of these approach for exampl is that fear and anxieti increas the body' product of hormon like adrenalin which can slow down labour and make contract feel wors
with techniqu includ make one' birth space feel homey and comfort be support by a birth partner or team use breath or medit techniqu and abov all go into labour feel relax and confid the idea is that you can encourag the product of oxytocin instead make labour faster and less pain
the popularis of 'natural' birth in particular ha a long histori it date back to at least the 1930 interestingli around the same time that the first colleg of obstetr and gynaecolog wa found
and for mani women approach like these have never held much weight if you want to give birth as painlessli as possibl whi not just use everi modern medic intervent and drug availablebut for other thi imag of the 'natural' ideal birth ha stuck amplifi by a boom birtheduc industri
on social media beauti stori of relax water birth with sooth music and candl everywher aboundther are mani benefit to these birth movement not least their aim to put the decisionmak back into the birth parent' hand
but with both 'positive' and 'natural' increas as common cultur ideal for some women there is a downsid
no number of class or relax techniqu can alway overcom the realiti that the circumst of everi birth are differ that there are huge racial and ethnic dispar in qualiti of care that matern care can be subpar overal or that women sometim feel pressur to accept intervent
even the simplest goal of feel empow dure labour or have fond memori of birth can feel out of reach
it' also worth note that both the time and financi invest that some of these cours requir make them out of reach for mani – they can cost less than 50 £41 onlin or upward of 1000 £815 for privat guidanc and usual requir at least sever hour of instructionpropon of thi approach say that medic provid need to step up to fix these problem rather than mother lower their expect
but in the meantim for women whose labour don’t go as plan have a highli specif – and often idealis – birth vision in mind can put undu pressur on what is ultim an unpredict experi
in the worst case they can feel as if they have fail themselv – or their babi
an ideal – not a norm the 'natural' birth in which everyth unfold perfectli and without a need for intervent remain far from the norm
in the us in 2020 for exampl cdc data show nearli a third of all birth includ an induct of labour
in addit a third were caesarean deliveri csection
home birth often held up as the ultim 'natural' labour account for just 1 of all birthsbut for mani birth parent who emphasis natur birth as the goal of their 'positive' approach their labour don't alway go to plan – and thi can have rippl effect
some mother say that by focus onli on their ideal birth they were blindsid by the realiti – and felt addit grief for not get to experi the perfect birth they want
in one studi 15 of women who had an unplan csection report that they felt as though they’d failededwina moorhous consid herself a 'positive' birth convert after smooth birth experi with all three of her children credit courtesi of edwina moorhousethi articl is part of the bbc’ famili tree seri

perri had a postpartum haemorrhagelook back she say she probabl should have had a csection
but she had been set against it
feel like there wa one 'right' way to have a babi it made me laser focus on that right way she say
and of cours there' not one right way
but i wa so wrap up in thi vision of how natur 'intended' you to have a babi
becaus she wa so focus on maintain a posit mindset go into her labour perri say she didn’t prepar herself for the possibl that it might go differ
as a result when thing start to go sideway it wa veri hard for me to adaptfor her second child she tri to listen to the same relax audio track she'd use to prepar for her first
she found it so anxieti induc that she had to stopemiliana hall is a ukbas doula and founder of the mind birth group which help women prepar for birth

it' that they blame themselv for it
thi can be the risk of an approach that focus so much on mindset she say mani cours recommend listen onli to posit birth stori or even replac neg word like contract with surg to keep fear and anxieti and therefor stress hormon and theoret pain at bay
if a woman doe wind up feel pain or trauma she might question if it wa becaus she wasn't relax enough
when it doesn't work it feel like either they fail or it wa a complet wast of time say hall
but there are so mani thing that you can't control
in her cours say hall she is care not to even use the phrase posit birth – becaus despit teach techniqu to make birth better she' acut awar that there' no guarante thing will go as plan
'i can't just have been lucki three time right'
of cours plenti of mother have found posit birth approach help even transformativein berlin edwina moorhous 32 thought they sound hippi
but after watch a youtub vlogger enthus about her experi she put asid her sceptic
i realli want that joy that you see that she ha she say
she took a hypnobirth cours practis breath techniqu and underw weekli acupunctur
she had a smooth fast water birth
her second labour wa similar
by her third child where she drag pink himalayan salt lamp big headphon and warm sock to her hospit room to make it cosier she wa a convert
i can't just have been lucki three time right
there must be someth to thi she say
to think that by my third son i wa religi listen to hypnobirth mp3 flood my brain with posit stori on youtub spend a stupid amount of money on thi one shampoo that had a scent that offer instant pain relief – i am complet unrecognis to the woman that wa pregnant six year ago
inde there is some evid that the techniqu taught in mani of these birth cours can reduc pain and epidur use lessen the number of intervent and the length of labour itself lower csection rate and improv a mother' overal birth experi
but these find aren't alway replic and some aspect seem to be more use than other
one larg review show although some popular element like the presenc of a train birth partner or use music or massag to relax help reduc the likelihood that a woman would look back on her birth experi as neg other techniqu were less usefulanoth review show music yoga and relax techniqu like guid medit might help reduc pain
but they made no differ in lower the rate of birth intervent includ csection or of whether women ultim need pharmacolog pain relieffrom a medic standpoint it' gener accept that sinc each intervent ha it own risk and cost they shouldn't be done unnecessarili or in the case of painmanag intervent without full inform consent
an epidur for exampl may be link to a longer second stage of labour and higher chanc of need an instrument birth and in rare case fever or nerv damag
but women who follow 'positive' birth approach say that the underton sometim can go further than that make birth parent feel as if ani intervent is bad
the messag is that you'r made for it it' natur women have been do it sinc the dawn of time your bodi know what it' do your babi know what it' do say beth sandland a lifestyl blogger and founder of the digit magazin the motherhood edit
i wouldn't say it' fear monger
but i would say that there is definit an underton of 'the hospit don't necessarili act in your best interest
the doctor don't necessarili have a realist approach to physiolog birth' in some of the cours and socialmedia account that she' seen say the 26yearoldfor mani the most import aspect of have a 'positive' birth come down to one thing autonomi credit getti imagesyet intervent alon aren't necessarili the ultim arbit of a 'positive' experi
inde research ha found that one of the most import aspect of whether a woman thought her birth wa posit wa how long the labour took
those who had shorter labour were more satisfi – even when their labour wa shorten by an intervent like say oxytocin augment
given the effect of prolong labour the research conclud intervent to avoid that could result in a 'net benefit'
for mani women of cours intervent also can be lifesav
how it' present is like you don't have to do what they tell you
and like the doctor are kind of out to get you in a way say carr
they'r like 'oh it' not riski
it' natural'
that can be true but not alway
i think for me there wa risk
if i hadn't had ani medic intervent one of us might not have surviv … i don't think in the wild i would have birth that babi easili
'i studi for it like it wa an exam' a big part of the posit birth movement involv empower
inde feel in control and be involv in decisionmak is a big part of have had a posit experi
and even if there are complic dure deliveri some women still find certain techniqu that help them feel in control to be use
in glasgow anna murray 34 did all of the prepar she possibl could for her labour
i studi for it like it wa an exam she say
she did a privat cours with a doula read book follow a yoga hypnobirth cours
she even had a googl drive folder with all of her audio track and yoga video for differ birth positionsin the end she need an unexpect caesarean – her son had grown too big and wa in a fix posit that no amount of exercis could turn
but the breath techniqu help her stay calm on the oper tabl she say
it can help you have a calm control birth whatev you have
but ultim it can't realli give you ani more control over what' go to happen she saysmurray' birth speak to the nuanc natur of how mani women experi the posit birth ideal today
for some it pan out exactli as they dream and give them the techniqu to help make it happen
for other it' a crush disappoint
and for those like murray the techniqu can provid use tool to make the best out of a difficult situationultim for mani the most import aspect of have a posit birth come down to one thing autonomi
that doesn't just mean feel empow whether in a labour ward or at a home birth
it also mean not feel pressur to birth in ani specif wayand as a cultur it mean recognis that everi woman’ physiolog medic condit and birth process will look differ be care not to lionis ani particular kind of experi as a cookiecutt ideal – whether it’ one that take place under anaesthesia or in a candlelit bath

as i saw my thought take shape on the blank page i wa instantli hookeda an author and journalist i recognis how lucki i am to be follow these childhood ambit but i would be lie if i said there aren’t regular period when that passion ebb
thi is particularli so in the dank and dull of london in januari when my mood is alreadi low and the repetit of the weekli deadlin can start to feel exhaust
i feel like i’m on a neverend treadmil – and i want to jump offi’m hardli alon as the recent trend in ‘quiet quitting’ ha reveal mani peopl are lose their enthusiasm for the career they onc love
you may have done everyth within your power to attain the perfect job and yet the daili grind sometim sap you of your enthusiasm
“in my experi with my coach client i would say that is a big issu and that thi problem is growing” say anna k schaffner a life coach in the uk who specialis in exhaust burnout and resili and the author of the art of selfimprovementfor some a loss of passion may be a sign that you need to chang career – but such a drastic move is not alway possibl
fortun recent studi show that some peopl natur appli “cultiv strategies” to reignit their passion and motiv – and there are mani way we can all appli these techniqu
a matter of mindsetth first studi come from patricia chen a professor of psycholog at the univers of texa at austin uschen’ previou research examin the influenc of two differ mindset about passion
socal “fit theorists” are more like to endors statement such asth “develop theorists” in contrast are more like to agre with statement such asus detail questionnair that measur people’ mindset and variou workplac outcom chen found that these belief becom selffulfil propheci
the fit theorist will struggl to find happi in a job that doesn’t meet their specif criteria
the develop theorist in contrast can learn to find enjoy and interest in the differ task so that their satisfact grow over time even if the job didn’t initi tick all the desir boxessplit up project into quick bites task can allow you to enjoy the warm feel of satisfact when you tick them off your plan credit getti imageschen’ new paper aim to explor how the develop theorist manag their passion in thi way
what strategi do they use to fan the flame of their zeal for workto find out she first survey 316 undergradu of variou academ disciplin about the way their passion for their subject had chang throughout time
crucial thi includ an openend question on what had caus thi chang in passion
from the hundr of respons the research identifi five common strategi that the student claim had rais their motiv
they wereoveral chen confirm that the student with the develop mindset were more like to see posit increas in their passion for their subject over time and that chang wa correl with the number of the passion cultiv strategi that they had use
the student with the fit mindset in contrast did not seem to be employ those strategi so effectivelymak motivationchen’ find chime with broader psycholog research look at the way that peopl regul their interest and motiv in their work
besid confirm the use of the strategi that chen had identifi – such as identifi the person or societ relev of the work – these studi suggest a few other way of reviv your mojo
two of the most use techniqu are “proxim goal setting” and “selfconsequating”
these are particularli use when you feel overwhelm with a new project in which the challeng is so great and the reward so distant that you struggl to summon up the enthusiasm to get startedto appli proxim goal set you would split the project into bites task that are much quicker to complet – allow you to enjoy the warm feel of satisfact when you tick them off your plan
“thi can be especi effect if you use littl reward for achiev those goal such as watch netflix after you’v complet an assignment” say maik trautner a postdoctor research at the univers of münster germani
that’ the selfconsequ partonc again mindset matter
in a recent studi with malt schwinger a professor at philipp univers of marburg in germani trautner survey more than 700 student on the way they handl their motiv
just as chen observ with her work on passion they found that some student believ that motiv for a task is fix and unchang while other believ that it can be cultiv
and it is those with the latter mindset who will then look for way to build their motiv use practic strategi while those who believ their motiv wa beyond their control were less proactiv
take actionfor peopl who alreadi have the develop mindset these strategi may seem obviou
but chen’ work suggest they are in the minor in her sampl most peopl had the fit mindset and could therefor benefit from be remind of their potenti to build their motiv and passiontak some time to think about our overal goal look for the benefit our work is provid to other reach out to inspir colleagu and set out a plan with small reward – these are simpl strategi that we could all take to boost our enthusiasmtak up a hobbi can give you a sens of purpos and achiev so that your job is not the onli place to find satisfact in your life credit getti imagesy don’t have to assum all the respons howev
schaffner suggest talk to your boss about the way you can chang your job so that it is more close align with your valu and interest – a process she describ as “job crafting”
“good employ should be interest in that and support of the idea it make perfect sens for their employe to be given task that they are most suit to perform well” she saysif you still feel like you are in a rut you might simpli be ask too much from your career
in much the same way that we might expect our romant partner to gener all the excit in our life – which put unnecessari pressur on the relationship – we can sometim have unrealist expect of our job to provid mean in our livesfor thi reason schaffner suggest take up a hobbi that could also give you a sens of purpos and achiev so that your job is not the onli place to find satisfact in your life

some recent statist tell a similar stori a 2021 survey of adult age 18 to 45 across the us conduct by the kinsey institut at indiana univers and sexretail lovehoney show that among marri adult millenni were the most like to “report problem with sexual desir in the past year”
the survey show 258 of marri millenni report thi problem while onli 105 of marri gen z and 212 of marri gen x adult report the samealthough “low desir isn’t necessarili synonym with be in a sexless marriage” say justin lehmil research fellow at the kinsey institut “when one or both partner in a marriag experi a dropoff in desir for sex sexual frequenc usual declin – and loss of desir is one of the biggest reason whi marriag becom sexless in the first place”what exactli is go on
sex therapist and research suggest a varieti of factor that may explain millennials’ sexless marriag from their current life stage to the almighti influenc of the internet

anoth wide use measur for a sexless marriag is have sex fewer than 10 time a yearexpert who spoke with bbc worklif also had vari idea
new york citybas sex therapist stephen snyder say “i usual think of ‘sexless’ as four time a year or less” unless that coupl is “have sex quarterli and they both say it' awesome”
kimberli anderson sex therapist and assist professor of psychiatri at ucla' school of medicin put the rate of a ‘lowsex’ marriag at fewer than 25 time per year
other say the definit is pure subject if a coupl is unhappi with the frequenc at which they’r have sex there’ a problem worth address
mani factor can lead to a sexless or lowsex marriag
if there’ a “desir discrepancy” as californiabas sex therapist christen lozano put it that imbal can grow over time if the coupl doesn’t do a good job of address it
the person who want more sex and keep initi it might give up and lose selfesteem if they continu to get reject for instanc

busi live with work andor children can remov sex from the equat too as can poor commun about each partner’ desiresalthough these aspect contribut to sexless marriag aren’t particular to ani gener some expert have notic a shift in who’ experienc sexless relationship and at what period in their lives“it’ becom a shorter amount of time in which coupl becom sexless” believ san franciscobas sex therapist celest hirschman who’ been see client for about 20 year

“thirti year ago a major of the coupl i treat for sexless marriag were 50plus” she say struggl with decreas libido from the hormon chang and ill that come with agingtoday howev most of the coupl in sexless marriag that anderson see are 45 and younger
“the underli dynam are quit differ than they werear with older couples” she saysth weight of stresstoo much stress can get in the way of anyone’ sex life – and millenni are especi riddl with cortisol
“stress is one of the biggest libido killers” say lehmil “and millenni are a particularli stress group in mani way especi compar to gen x”major life stage are one factor
mani millenni are at the age at which they’r becom new parent or have young children an overwhelm time in people’ live
in a 2018 studi from ukbas counsel network relat 61 of peopl in their 30 report have less sex than they’d like becaus “young children are in the way” with 31 say they’v “lost their libido sinc have children”
other gener struggl also feed into stress millenni were alreadi behind prior gener to meet life mileston like buy home now spike price and the prolifer of student debt are strain millenni especi financiallybut most of all the current state of the workplac is drive stress
may 2022 data from global consult firm deloitt collect across five countri reveal 38 of millenni report a massiv mentalhealth burden especi for women 41 versu men 36 larg driven by work anxietyth work environ ha never been particularli stabl or low stress for millenni of cours
“for exampl mani millenni start their career dure the great recession” say lehmil
but the ad burden of the covid19 pandem ha brought with it further strife“dur time of great technolog chang peopl tend to work extrem hard” add snyder
and as data show millenni are particularli workahol
overwork often lead to exhaust which can lead to coupl repeatedli be too tire for sex at the end of a long day – a pattern these expert say can endur if repeat too regularli
and worri around financi stabil are onli exacerb the problem
“greater financi concern coupl with higher baselin rate of depress and anxieti could be a particularli potent combin in produc high stress and low sexual desire” say lehmillersom expert report that the rise of easili access pornographi and imagedriven social media are interrupt intimaci credit getti imagessoci media pornographi and declin sex livesth influenc of the internet also can’t be overst
snyder describ social media as a “distraction” from physic interperson activ like sex but hirschman believ it role in contribut to sexless marriag goe much deeper
she say it’ led to increas “imag consciousness” among millenni – the first gener to realli be conscript into heavi socialmedia use
peopl feel the need to present perfect on these platform she say with filter and touchup that aren’t avail in real life
the result selfconsci can follow peopl into their bedroom and marriag make them less bodi confid
per relate’ 2018 data 37 of peopl younger than 30 who were in lowsex partnership report selfconsci about their bodi while onli 14 of those 60 and older said the samein addit to social media the expert agre porn ha had an outsiz influenc on millenni mani of whom came of age just as porn wa becom wide access onlin
thi of cours is a huge shift from previou gener
“in the 20th centuri some guy tend to be sexual compuls with lot of women” say snyder
“these day they just tend to watch lot of porn” in other word they don’t have to seek out sex with anoth person to have a sexual experi that involv other peopl even if those peopl are onli in a videoanderson ha mani youngerthan45 male client in sexless marriag who suffer from “porninduc erectil dysfunction” she say – a condit that make it either imposs or veri difficult to achiev an erect without pornographi and with a reallif partner
thi can lead to them prefer solo sex over sex with their partner
some of them get use to have total control over their pleasur she explain or to the more extrem imag they see in porn that their marri sex can’t live up to
‘porn never reject me’ or ‘porn never criticis my performance’ are common comment in my office” say anderson‘dead bedrooms’ forev
of cours millenni can’t chang that they enter the workforc dure a recess and are now reel from anoth one
they can’t eras the influenc of porn or social mediaand it' clear that a lack of sex is a topic some peopl find hard to even talk about with the person with whom they are share a bedroom let alon more broadli – make understand the issu and find solut even harder
as one redditor wrote on rdeadbedroom just a coupl day ago with busi live and myriad pressur even rais the subject can seem imposs

worklife,"when christian got laid off in late 2022 he wasn’t surpris
the 31yearold base in new york citi knew he’d fallen behind on hi project as a manag consult and underperform with essenti job duties“i had a tough time grappl with the sort of execut function that our world oper by like be abl to set up meet follow through with thing focu and be detail oriented” he say
hi manag had point out these fail for month which is whi hi termin wa hardli shockingit’ not that he conscious slack at work say christian – hi adhd got in the way
christian ha been live with the diagnosi of attentiondeficit hyperact disord sinc he wa 15
it help put a name to whi he struggl with certain task hi peer often don’t – the same thing that ultim got him sack
and while hi adhd wa mostli manag through univers it effect ramp up when he got into the workforc
it’ held him back ever sinceglob data from 2020 estim the rate of adult adhd at 258 yet mani peopl remain undiagnos especi in minor commun
thi mean million experi hurdl like christian’ – and some don’t even know whi
but even for peopl who do have a label for their struggl a diagnosi isn’t necessarili a fix mani worker with adhd experi challeng that can inhibit success
and whether they reveal their issu to manag or keep them privat the effect of adhd follow them around in their career affect their job secur career option work relationship and even how they feel about themselvesyet as adhd diagnos tick up so too ha awar – and thi can help contextualis these workers’ struggl for both colleagu and employ and potenti illumin new pathway for supportsom worker with adhd find it hard to get start and differ like these can send them into a selfjudg spiral credit getti imagesmor than ‘kid who fidget’adhd is not just about oftstereotyp ‘squirmy’ kid and peopl who get distract easili say texasbas traci winter an execut and leadership coach at nerd coach who specialis in neurodivers
instead adhd is a complex neurodevelopment disord which manifest in divers symptom and behaviour though the word ‘disorder’ is controversi point out winter who also ha adhd she prefer to look at it as a “differ kind of brain”
the adhd brain isn’t necessarili flighti she explain – anatom it structur look differ and function differ
peopl with adhd each experi it effect divers say henri shelford chairperson and cofound of chariti adhd uk and there’ no way to know how it’ll appear in someone’ life
some struggl with be on time or keep a desk that look like someth explod for instanc other are neat as a pin and alway punctual yet can’t stop themselv from interrupt in convers
some peopl say winter onli tend to do what they’r interest in – “what light up our brains” – which caus them to deprioritis other urgent tasksit effect in the workplac can be particularli acut where norm around behaviour and process can drive boss to label adhd employe lazi disengag or incap
“adhd trait can be realli badli misinterpreted” say shelford
“if i struggl with timeli you’r go to think i don’t care about my job
if i forget someth you might just conclud i’m dumb” beyond bosses’ percept often these workplac struggl can make worker with adhd judg themselv too caus damag emot impactsrebecca phillip epstein a televis writer and essayist who wa recent diagnos with adhd struggl constantli in her earli career to show up to meet prepar and on time as well as hit deadlin
the issu onli compound as she climb the career ladder
and while she could usual manag on the fli she say she felt terribl constantli exist on the edg of failur
“a i got older the world got bigger… i start to slip and i start to struggle” explain epstein now 37
epstein felt she “should be abl to do what everyon els can do” so she wound up “torturing” herself balanc perfection with a feel of be incap of perform as expect
christian too ha been down on himself despit know he’ neurodiverg someon whose brain differ affect how their brain work
“there’ a whole element of shame and guilt” he say
“your behaviour start to close door of opportun and then those door are shut … when i just forget or stall someth until last minut i start to go down the spiral
‘whi couldn't i do thi
whi aren't i good enough
whi can't i do what thi person could do’”thi selfjudg is one of the problemat knockon effect that can send peopl with adhd into neg emot state
“there can be an element of like ‘whi bother when i'm not go to do it right
i'm just go to get a neg response’ say winter
thi can trigger a common reaction of “reject sensit dysphoria” which she say “i a much deeper feel of reject at a critique” – one that can erod selfconfid and emot wellb
and although reject sensit is not uniqu to peopl with adhd it can be exacerb in peopl with the conditionth problem with ‘masking’often peopl with adhd are uneasi about ask for help becaus it mean announc their diagnosisth stigma of adhd is still veri present – it can be view as a condit for children or someth that isn’t much of a challeng
“there are plenti of peopl still out there who don't believ in adhd” say winter
thi can lead to sceptic of the idea that some people’ brain function differ as a resultmani worker instead engag in “masking” to compens
“it’ an idea of ‘who do i need to present as to be accepted’ … restrain oneself from a lot of natur impulses” just to fit in with colleagu she say
mask can be effect for a short period of time but it is rare sustain and often deplet
“it’ almost like minimis your own ident to conform with social norm … it’ uncomfort and it’ exhaust and if you do it enough you can lose track of who is behind the mask”som worker with adhd choos to keep their diagnos and struggl secret for fear of judgement which mean they can't get the accommod they need credit getti imagesfor worker who do come forward about their diagnos howev the convers can be riski
in some situat ask for accommod – like fewer meet or differ work hour – may spur boss and colleagu to view them as difficult to work with or not cut out for the workflow of a teamthat’ what kim to found when she work in financ in london in her earli 20 – a posit she thought of as a dream job
but she say “i wa cri everi singl day” she wa so tire from mask she becam overwhelmedto help her succeed she ask her boss for bit of help – an assist app for grammar and spell and the abil to work from home away from distract
but her request were met with corpor constern
when she tri to work around her challeng by creat her own system spreadsheet and schedul that other colleagu didn’t use she say peopl would tell her that she wa “just make excuses” for whi she couldn’t perform like everyon els or need special treatmenteventu to stop ask for accommod and tri to function like her colleagu
but thi didn’t work either
“peopl would observ me and think ‘oh she’ not realli cut out for thi industry’ she say
“it wasn’t so much the workflow
i wa actual veri good at the work and i like the work
it wa becaus i wa constantli tri to conform” she ultim had a breakdown and left the world of financ
dure the next five year she began and quit sever more job alway find herself out of place
although she didn’t have an adhd diagnosi at the time she now realis her executivefunct disord wa at the core of her struggleseven for high perform some boss may question the need to provid accommod say winter “if manag don't see where the challeng are whi would they do anyth to address them” but in mani case she say a worker’ strong perform may come from mask to ultim detriment effect
forward stepswork with adhd will almost alway have challeng in the workplac even if they are abl to work with understand and accommod boss or get the assist tool they request
but thing may be look up at least in part
as adhd diagnos have increas in the past decad sheldon say thi knowledg ha enabl more peopl to seek help from their employ
some manag may also be more open due to rise awar – in some case as some see diagnos within their own famili say winterplu the pursuit of a more accommod workplac ha had an unlik hero covid19
prior to the pandem work flexibl wa rare and it wa difficult for all employe to make the person adjust that could help them succeed
now far more peopl have autonomi over how and where they do their job
so as work cultur begin to becom more adapt than they onc were manag are increasingli awar worker can thrive in untradit work cultur – someth that can be particularli help for peopl with adhd
of cours educ employ and make workplac more inclus is import too
now 28 to ha becom a coach and speaker who work with both employe and corpor to bring awar to the challeng and strength of peopl with adhd
she say neurodivers train and workplac adjust benefit everyone“peopl think accommod need to cost a lot of money
a lot don’t cost anyth at all” she say
these adjust can be softwar chang that help make screen more readabl provid quiet space where interrupt are limit or observ strict calendar or meet boundari to avoid unexpect disrupt
to also believ employ need to stop think of these accommod as favour for worker
“you’r not give someon an unfair advantag
you’r just give peopl choic
and give peopl choic mean better outcomes” in the meantim howev worker with adhd may be on the back foot especi if they’r not in an environ with support managementa for christian he’ secur a new job
but he’ fulli awar he’ll be up against the same challeng he experienc in hi last role
“ultim we live in a world where we'r judg by the thing that most neurotyp peopl have an easi time do but neurodiverg peopl have a much more challeng time doing” he say

worklife,"when market manag eliza return from holiday she receiv an email from her boss ask her to arriv at work earli the next day
“i instantli fear the worst” she explain
“i knew the job wasn’t the best fit
i’d had my probat previous extend there wa an expect of weekend work and postwork drink that didn’t suit me
i thought he’d use my time off as an opportun to fire me”howev when eliza arriv at her boss’ offic she wasn’t immedi let go
instead she wa inform of a compani restructur – her job descript wa be complet rewritten
someon els would take over her task and she would be expect to work remot in a new admin role
in the week that follow eliza’ profession life becam much quieter
instead of formul the londonbas event agency’ market strategi from the offic or attend live show as part of her remit her main duti now consist of simpli be avail between 0900 and 1800 send the occasion email and complet the odd routin task from home
eliza had effect been frozen out by her employ
bare a month later she quit
“it wa humili – i wa made to feel worthless” she say
“it wa the worst experi of my career i’d rather have been just fire on the spot and paid off than have to go through that”ther may not alway be a good fit between job and the worker hire to do them
in these case compani and boss may decid they want the worker to depart
some may go through formal channel to show employe the door but other may do what eliza’ boss did – behav in such a way that the employe choos to walk away
method may vari boss may marginalis worker make their live difficult or even set them up to fail
thi can take place over week but also month and year
either way the object is the same to show the worker they don’t have a futur with the compani and encourag them to leav
in overt case thi is known as ‘construct dismissal’ when an employe is forc to leav becaus the employ creat a hostil work environ
the more subtl phenomenon of nudg employe slowli but sure out of the door ha recent been dub ‘quiet firing’ the appar flipsid to ‘quiet quitting’ where employe do their job but no more
rather than lay off worker employ choos to be indirect and avoid conflict
but in do so they often unintent creat even greater harmth path of least resistancefor myriad reason boss have long tri to nudg worker they perceiv as underperform or be a bad cultur fit out the door
“thi ha been happen in workplac for decades” say christoph kay professor of manag at the georg washington univers school of busi base in washington dcthe reason for thi are complex
if worker behav in way that violat their contract for exampl compani can termin their employ
but if boss simpli dislik worker or see them as middl or mediocr perform take action to remov them is more complic often requir lengthi process involv perform manag programm and multipl warnings“compani are usual reluct to let a worker go” say kay
fire lead to an “immedi sens of side be created” which at worst can land the compani in court if the worker contest it potenti gener neg headlin about the work environ
“it’ often easier to simpli let the underperform employe stay in the job than to go through the process of fire and potenti litigation”employ often don’t want to expos themselv to risk or conflict add suzann horn partner in employ law at legal firm paul hast base in london
“subtli encourag someon to leav is seen as the easier option
if the employe eventu resign it’ the ‘nofault approach’ sever doesn’t need to be paid conflict is avoid and both parti are ultim happy”manag perceiv poor perform work with the employe to improv their output and turn them into a use resourc for the compani would be an altern way to deal with the problem
howev kay say boss are often illequip to do thi whether through a lack of time or train
“organis tend to be bad at prepar leader to take on the respons they’ll need in the job
so they often find themselv without the resourc they need to be effect and deal with employe underperformance” in thi situat with fire seen as a last resort and manag unabl – or unwil – to turn the employe into what they want them to be they often follow the path of least resist quiet fire
“much of it is ultim an avoid behaviour and come down to procrastin manag in most case are want to avoid have difficult conversations” point out kay
“iron they worri that fire a worker will reflect poorli on them so they quietli fire them instead”to push out worker manag may sometim set up worker to fail with imposs task or take away their job altogeth credit getti imageswhi it often backfir by engag in quietfir behaviour manag are like to be play the long game
in theori it’ low risk and minim effort the hope is that by withdraw support the worker soon realis they don’t have a futur at the compani and move elsewherehowev thi approach can have collater damag
the tactic mean firm and manag can end up saddl with worker they don’t want lead to manag engag in behaviour often seen as passiveaggress say kay
“you stop offer the employe opportun to advanc you stop invit them to certain meet you stop provid them import work and feedback” there is also the risk of creat an ‘u and them’ mental potenti harm worker not target for quiet fire
“you have the engag employe and then those just quietli left there sometim without their knowledge” say horn
“it doesn’t creat an inclus or highperform workplac culture” quiet fire can affect a firm’ reput too even if a worker depart without appar conflict employe may well share their experi in an onlin review
“there’ a greater awar of employ right today” say horn
“peopl are now more will to call out workplac issu especi follow the pandemic” an employe subtli nudg out the door isn't without legal recours either
“if you were to look at each individu aspect of quiet fire there’ like noth seriou enough to prove an employ breach of contract” say horn
“howev there’ the laststraw doctrin one final act by the employ which when ad togeth with past behaviour can be assert as construct dismiss by the employee”mor immedi though is the mentalhealth cost to the worker deem to be expend by the employ – but who is never directli inform
“the psycholog toll of quiet fire creat a sens of reject and of be an outcast from their work group
that can have a huge neg impact on a person’ wellbeing” say kay
eliza agre
“i wa made to feel worthless and useless be quietli fired” she say
now happili employ elsewher she’ realis that her experi “wa a reflect of have a terribl boss rather than me”
but other peopl who experi quiet fire over the longer term in more insidi way may not see thing so clearly“ov time an employe may figur out someth isn’t right if their onetoon meet are alway cancel their manag never make time to talk about develop and perform or they’r alway overlook for promotion” say horn
“they face a daili drip feed of their employ tri to make them resign – it’ absolut gruelling” 'a selffulfil prophecy'quiet fire may be the easiest option on the tabl for boss – especi in a remotework world where exclud employe is even easier – but it’ not a good solut for firm or workers“employ can end up damag their business’ moral product and cultur while risk litig proceed anyway” say horn

so she wa confus when as a teenag “hi behaviour turn hostil and he start lock himself in the toilet for hour at a time” she recal
“when i confront him he’d tell me i wa the mad one the one on drug
sometim i want to laugh it wa so ridiculous” when helen found out he wa use heroin she didn’t know where to turn
he would disappear for day return with all kind of injuri
when he wa at home he wa difficult to be around
“he never hit me but would often destroy the flat in anger – there’ still a hole in the corridor where he kneed it” she explainsat work she wa paid in cash which she say her son began take from her wallet
not want to say anyth in case he got violent she began keep the money in a belt around her waist

she ultim felt unsaf live with someon deep in an addict and cut contact with himth relationship between a parent and their child is expect to be lifelong – a fruit love bond that can surviv ani high and low
howev for some parent maintain thi connect can be difficult
eventu a parent might feel they have reach a point of no return and so choos to step away from their rolesom parent who decid to sever tie say they do so for their own health and safeti credit getti imagesin an increasingli polaris world convers about children who stop speak to their parent have becom common
yet it also happen the other way around even if the discours is less frequent
thi may be in part becaus data indic parent sever tie with their children is rarer a 2015 studi conduct by the british estrang chariti stand alon show that 5 of estrang parent had initi it themselvesth decis is alreadi difficult and pain and those who experi thi estrang say it rel rariti make it especi isol and can add to stigma for those who choos to pursu thi path‘uncondit love can be problematic’“in both research and popular cultur we rare hear from parent who estrang themselv from their children becaus it’ so taboo and there are veri few nonjudgement place to speak openli about the experience” explain luci blake a senior lectur in psycholog at univers of the west england bristol who specialis in estrangementth reason parent end relationship with their children are similar to the reason kid cut off their parent accord to blake among the most common cite are famili conflict differ in person valu such as religi belief substanc abus and other toxic behaviour
the stand alon research show that for relationship breakdown with son issu link to divorc inlaw and marriag were the most wide report driver while with daughter mentalhealth problem and emot abus were more commonyet thi decis to fractur with children tend to be far more tri and ultim difficult
societ parent are expect to cherish and care for offspr without except
“we have veri high almost godlik expect of a parent where we want them to be uncondit loving” explain blake
“thi can be quit problemat as it suggest they should accept ani kind of treatment includ all kind of psycholog and financi abuse”thi is perhap whi even when their children are hurt them parent struggl to let go
jennif storey a psycholog lectur at the univers of kent uk who specialis in interperson violenc find that in most of her interview with victim of elder abus parent are still worri and sad for their children
“i am struggl to rememb one parent who realli want to cut their child off – they almost alway want the relationship to continu but the abus to end” she explainsit can also be hard for both them and the peopl around them to accept the realiti of what’ happen
“parent are assum to have all the power but as the child grow older that power dynam shifts” say amanda holt author of the book adolescenttopar abus current understand in research polici and practic
“the lack of belief that childpar abus can happen or that it can be so bad a parent need to leav is anoth reason that it’ so difficult to walk away”th “intergener stake hypothesis” may also be at work
thi theori suggest that parent are typic more invest – emot financi and physic – in the parentchild relationship than their children
greater posit tie with children are associ with a parent’ improv wellb a greater qualiti of life and lower depress symptom greater posit tie with a parent do not guarante the same benefit
thi mean that the parent’ choic to sever contact with a child whether abruptli or gradual doesn’t just come with the weight of failure“parenthood is a role and ident that’ respect and admir – it’ also lifechang and lifelong” explain blake
“when a parent doe not have an activ relationship with their child they might feel they have fail in thi role bring feel of intens pain and shame chang or challeng how parent think about themselv and who they are”given these element it can be more challeng for parent to sever tie than it is for children
“it could certainli be a differ kind of pain becaus for parent there’ the possibl that their life seem emptier or less meaningful” say blake

“i email my ex to say it appear my daughter no longer want to spend everi other weekend’ visit with me and if that were to chang in the futur she would be welcom back with open arms” say jack
he doesn’t blame hi daughter for act as she did but hasn’t heard from or seen her sinc
although hi daughter cut off contact initi jack hasn’t felt the need to rekindl contact with her directli

thi isn’t an uncommon situat say expert “for some estrang parent there’ no one clear answer on who initi it and it’ quit messy” say blake

worklife,"in the tv seri the good place the charact chidi anagony is defin by hi inabl to make even the simplest of decis – from choos what to eat to proclaim love for hi soulmat
the veri idea of make a choic often result in a seriou stomachach
he is stuck in continu ‘analysi paralysis’
we meet chidi in the afterlif and learn that hi indecis wa the caus of hi death
while stand in the street endlessli equivoc on which bar to visit with hi best friend an aircondit unit from the apart abov fall on hi head kill him instantli
“you know the sound that a fork make in the garbag dispos
that' the sound my brain make all the time” he say in one episod
and besid make himself unhappi chidi’ lack of confid in hi own judgement drive the peopl around him crazi
if that sound like an exagger version of you then you are not alon indecis is a common trait
while some peopl come to veri quick judgement other struggl to weigh up the option – and may even tri to avoid make a choic at all
as chidi show indecis can be link to problem like anxieti yet recent research suggest that it can also have an upsid – it protect us from common cognit error like confirm bia so that when the person doe final come to a judgement it is gener wiser than those who jump to a conclus too quickli
the trick is to learn when to wait and when to break through the inertia while it’ hold you back
the enemi of good psychologist have variou tool to measur indecis
one of the most common questionnair – the frost indecis scale – ask particip to rate a seri of statement on a scale of 1 strongli disagre to 5 strongli agre
they includ use thi scale psychologist have shown that indecis is often a product of perfection
perfectionist are scare of the shame or regret that may come with make the wrong choic – and so they put off make decis until they feel certain they are do the right thing
and in some case of cours they simpli never reach that level of confid
the frustrat thi bring can be a barrier to happi in gener the higher someon score on the scale abov the lower they will score on measur of life satisfact accord to a studi by eric rassin a professor of psycholog at erasmu univers in the netherland
they are less like to endors statement such as “the condit of my life are excellent” for exampl or “if i could live my life over i would chang almost nothing”indecis is often perceiv as a neg trait but there may be surpris advantag to take your time credit gettyjump to conclus from these result indecis would seem like a wholli undesir trait
recent research howev suggest that the struggl to come to a quick conclus – as uncomfort as it may be – can also have an upsid sinc it protect peopl from some import cognit bias
evid for these benefit come from a recent paper by janamaria hohnsbehn a doctor research and iri schneider a professor of social psycholog at the tu dresden technisch universität dresden
rather than use the frost indecis scale hohnsbehn and schneider focus on a measur of “trait ambivalence” which look more specif at the thought and feel underli someone’ judgement and decisionmak or lack thereof
for exampl peopl are ask to rate statement such as “if these statement reson with us then we are probabl high in trait ambivalence” say hohnsbehn
as you might expect those high in trait ambival take a longer time to make decis
but hohnsbehn and schneider found that they are also less prone to bia when come to their judgement
for exampl in one experi she ask her particip to read a seri of scenario such as you meet a person and you would like to find out whether hesh is an introvert or extrovert
you guess that the person is an extrovert
which of the follow two question would you ask
mani peopl pick the second question but thi is a sign of confirm bia – you are onli look for the inform that agre with your assumpt rather than look for evid that you may be wrong
hohnsbehn and her colleagu found that peopl with high trait ambival were less like to do thi
instead they chose to interrog their assumpt in order to make sure they had the inform they need to come to a correct answer
for anoth experi the particip read about an employe mr müller who wa seek to get hi contract renew
after make a preliminari decis about whether to allow mr müller to continu in the role the particip were given some addit statement which were ostens from industri expert about mr müller
some of these statement agre with the participants’ initi decis while other disagre
the participants’ task wa to rate the credibl and import of each one
hohnsbehn and schneider found that the peopl score high on ambival tend to be more openmind to the statement that disagre with their initi point of view and rate them more highli for their credibl and import – wherea those who show littl trait ambival were more like to discount them
these find are import sinc confirm bia is one of our most common cognit error prevent us from analys evid ration in everyth from our person relationship to our polit view
trait ambival help protect us from thi kind of oversimplist think – and may also help us with other form too
studi by schneider for instanc suggest that peopl with high trait ambival are also less prone to “correspond bias” which is a tendenc to ignor the context of someone’ behaviour and to instead attribut ani failur and success directli to the person themselv
to give a straightforward exampl if someon slip over correspond bia might lead us to conclud that they are inher clumsi an intern factor rather than recognis the slipperi of the floor an extern factor
correspond bia might also lead us to assum that someon struggl in their educ simpli lack intellig rather than consid the strain of their financi difficulti or their respons within the famili
peopl with high trait ambival are more like to recognis those other factor than peopl who form quick and confid judgementsindecis is onli a problem when it becom excess expert say credit gettyact over inact hohnsbehn’ research should be good news if you’v ever felt impati with your inabl to come to a quick decis
“the gener experi of be ambival need to be embraced” she suggest
“it can give us necessari paus signal to us that thing are complex and that we need more time to engag in more care thought about our decision” it is onli when thi becom excess that we face problem
“a with most thing there is a balanc that need to be struck” add hohnsbehn
that might explain whi indecis peopl often score lower on those measur of life satisfact – their ambival when face import choic ha becom overwhelm
one simpl step might be to set a time limit for your final decis so that you do not spend too much time rumin on the differ option without actual gain ani new insight
depend on the type of problem you are face hohnsbehn suggest you might even consid turn it into a seri of task – such as devot two hour to the search for new inform for exampl befor spend a certain amount of time deliber
if you still feel paralys you might find inspir in a studi by steven levitt an economist at the univers of chicago which examin people’ overal happi after make import life chang
levitt who is a coauthor of the book freakonom set up a websit where peopl describ variou dilemma they were face in their live – from get a tattoo to move hous return to educ or quit their job
the particip were then ask to flip a coin the outcom of which would tell them whether or not to make the chang
follow up with the particip over the follow month levitt found mani peopl had taken the plung if the coin toss had told them to take action they were more like to make the life chang
and they report be significantli happier than those who had simpli carri on as befor regardless of whether the coin had told them to or not without quit move or get that tattoo
we can guess that befor the studi most of these particip had alreadi been think care about the situat at hand but their worri about make the wrong choic had prevent them from take the plung
the coin had simpli act as a small nudg to final overcom their ambival
the moral of the studi then is not that we should make all decis on the whim of a toss coin
it is that break through your hesit and doubt will leav you happier than you might imagin
“a good rule of thumb in decis make is whenev you cannot decid what you should do choos the action that repres a chang rather than continu the statu quo” conclud levitt
like chidi in the good place we can weigh up all the pro and con of everi situat – and that ambival will help us to make wiser choic

it’ an industri that histor pay well even befor the pandem some of the biggest firm offer undergradu salari that often approach the sixfigur mark
howev in the current market nguyen’ client are do particularli well
“they’ll come back and say ‘i have two great offers’” explain the founder of my consult offer base in georgia us
“one is for 120000 £91630 the other is for 140000 £106900
today’ climat mean graduat can earn much more money than a few year ago”manag consult is among the sector in which graduat are increasingli walk straight from the lectur hall into sixfigur role – earn pay packet most peopl will never see in their lifetim
in big tech entrylevel softwar engin are often start on such wage
at the largest bank corpor pay for firstyear analyst ha spike nearli 30 – a 110000 £83979 base salari in some case
at the biggest london law firm some newli qualifi solicitor begin their career on a £107500 salari 141115
nguyen say “20yearold earn 100000 from the getgo” ha increasingli becom the norm sinc the pandemicoften these young employe are join firm where colleagu began with lower pay and had to work hard for year to earn six figur
such organis would argu it’ a respons to market need the hire crisi mean the competit for talent remain fierc if an employ want the best candid will to put in long hour they have to pay a high price for themhowev beyond match the market rate doe offer graduat huge pay packet actual bring benefit like incentivis longer hour or boost work ethic
or can it creat unintend consequ for both the young highearn as well as the wider workforce‘high pay is an expectation’ wage for graduat have been steadili rise for year
accord to 2021 data from us nonprofit the nation associ of colleg and employ the start salari for some entrylevel worker in particular field ha spike dramat for exampl the averag wage for a computersci major ha risen to 72173 £55100 – a 7 hike in just one yearnichola bloom professor of econom at stanford univers say demand for labour is fast outstrip suppli in sector particularli in tech
the financi industri – with job that often requir 70hourplu workweek – ha also driven up start salari to hire the best candid
so in most case graduat are be hand sixfigur salari simpli as a “blunt recruit tool” amid the current labour market condit add rue dooley an hr knowledg advisor for the societi for human resourc manag shrm base in the us“work want to be thought of as a prize asset by their employer” say dooley
“younger employe are say high pay is an expect not becaus they necessarili demand it but becaus they’r awar of the talent shortag and they know their price” thi mean some entrylevel worker can secur huge pay packet befor they’v even left the colleg dorm
“we’r regularli see firm doubl in size everi 18 month so graduat salari are close follow the market” add bloomin tech smaller startup are also now have to pay entrylevel employe higher salari to match the moreestablish corpor
josh brenner ceo of recruit marketplac hire base in new york citi say us employ are pay firstyear tech worker an averag start salari of 110027 £84000
nguyen’ undergrad client often land job with wage that dwarf the pay of hi own first manag consult role
he believ it to be a good thing
“the sixfigur start salari of today are an upward trend that stretch back decades” he say
“high pay open up opportun for peopl who simpli wouldn’t otherwis have had them and it doesn’t take money away from those who start on lower pay”in sector includ law consult financ and comput scienc graduat are snag pay packet mani peopl will never earn in their live credit getti imagesgolden handcuff – and other problemsbut while there are mani upsid to the rise of sixfigur salari these high compens packet can come with insidi consequencesin some case these worker may find themselv trap in job they hate especi if worker have built lifestyl around earn big payout – a phenomenon often call ‘golden handcuffs’nguyen say such wage can also skew young employees’ percept of pay block them from pursu more meaning career path
“some may want to eventu move into teach or work for a nonprofit
previous the salari drop wa around 50000
now it’ closer to 100000 – that could be enough to prevent someon from chang careers”hug salari can also weigh young employe with a psycholog burden
nguyen say some of hi undergradu client can feel intimid begin their work live in a job that pay a fortun
“there are some who come from lowincom background and think ‘what did i do to earn so much more than my parent ever made’ it can caus impost syndrome” other in the same organis can also feel neg effect when firsttim employe are hand sixfigur salari without hesit
for exampl experienc colleagu may bristl at entrylevel compens packet – especi when they take home less money than a recent graduat despit yearslong tenur at the compani
“it can creat pay dispar issues” say dooleyaddit compani themselv may not necessarili get what they pay for
while skyhigh wage can effect ‘buy’ a candidate’ willing to regularli clock unpaid overtim it doesn’t necessarili guarante better work ethic“th risk is employ in some case assum staff are go to be super motiv becaus of their high compens but in fact they take it for granted” say toma chamorro professor of busi psycholog at univers colleg london
“high wage may feel good when someon get a job but onc they start they typic want much more the effect of good pay will be psycholog ‘spent’” 'job to grab while you can'with the labour market as it is sixfigur start salari will probabl continu to be the norm in certain highpay industri
but it’ unlik there’l be much of a trickledown effect for entrylevel worker in less elit sectorsrath than push wage up across the board sixfigur salari for an ultraprivileg subset of employe may instead drive pay inequ deeper
“what we’r see is clearli increas inequ and the gap keep growing” say bloom
“if you have a computersci degre you can be earn 250000 by 25 while if you left school at 16 you might be earn 25000 – a tenfold difference”th gap will like keep grow even if the labour market snap back in term of suppli and demand
bloom explain while wage often rise they almost never fall
for exampl nguyen say salari in manag consult have long endur the rigour of recess
“we’v seen wage withstand so mani econom cycl firm plan for it and restructur pay but they wouldn’t ever get rid of the sixfigur salary”so given their resist to the ebb and flow of the market sixfigur graduat wage are not onli like to becom more and more ingrain they may also climb further
and if job becom scarcer due to a labourmarket normalis these pay packet will becom increasingli out of reach for most peopl

instead the solo polyamorist might see themselv as their own primari partner eschew typic relationship goal like merg financ or home with a partner and get marri and have children
solo polyamorist repres a small portion of polyamorist in gener mani of whom tend to have or aim to have a primari partner say philadelphiabas sex educ and therapist liz powel 39 so it’ inher difficult to figur out what percentag of the overal popul is engag in relationship thi way
howev some studi show younger gener are more like to have enter into some kind of nonmonogam relationship than older gener
per a 2020 yougov survey of 1300 us adult 43 of millenni said that their ideal relationship would be nonmonogam while just 30 of gen x said the same
overal research from 2016 synthesis two differ us studi show 20 of respond engag in a consensu nonmonogam relationship at some point
but these studi don’t break down those number by specif type of nonmonogam relationship so it’ imposs to say how mani of those survey identifi with solo polyamorysinc solo polyamorist are a minor ident misconcept about their lifestyl abound
from peopl who equat solo polyamori to monogamist date around until they find “the one” to those who consid it a selfish or greedi move like “have your cake and eat it too” there’ a tendenc to overlook the term’ more nuanc definit

“solo polyamor peopl tend to avoid intertwin their life in that way with someon else” though the definit may seem narrow there are plenti of way to be ‘solo poly’
solo polyamor folk tend to be allosexu say coloradobas elisabeth sheff author of book includ the polyamorist next door mean they tend to experi sexual desir – but some are asexu and maintain multipl nonsexu relationship
they also tend to “valu their independence” add sheff but some have veri import nonromant relationship in their live that they put first
“the singl parent who prioritis their children over all other relationship could be solo poly” say sheff as could someon who’ the caretak of a person with a disabilitysolo polyamori also doesn’t have to be forev

solo polyamori is not right for everyon
vrangalova ha her student take person quizz to help them determin the relationship style that might work best for them
these quizz ask question like “how much adventur and novelty” respond need or how much secur they requir in their relationship
solo polyamorist say vrangalova “usual don't need a lot of relat security”howev just becaus someon who identifi as solo poli may not need the same level of secur as someon in a longterm monogam partnership thi doesn’t mean they can’t or won’t form deep last bond with partner

see the rest of our best of worklif 2022 collect for more great readsdedek winston ha been in nonmonogam relationship for more than a decad yet she ha never seen such keen interest in open relationshipsth subject ha tradit been veri taboo in mani place includ the us where winston is base
in 2014 when she start the multiamori podcast she and her coproduc had to decid whether to use their real name on the ethnic nonmonogami show
“at that point there wa pretti much onli one or two other podcast actual broach thi subject” say the date coach
“and the peopl who were produc and host those podcast use pseudonyms” but thing have chang
around 2016 winston notic a real “explos of interest around nonmonogamy” about a year after she start work as a date coach specialis in those type of relationship
“that wa when i feel like i saw the biggest turn point of all of a sudden so mani peopl onlin be will to talk about be nonmonogamous” she say “and to express the fact that they have an interest in these sort of things”sarah levinson a counsellor at creativ relat psycholog psychotherapi in new york citi who specialis in sexual and relationship dynam ha also notic an increas interest in open relationship within the past decad
“it wa much more obscur 10 year ago and now it' incred common” she say
these account as well as some data show a grow interest in consensu nonmonogam relationship includ open relationship
expert say mani societ and cultur factor that have led to a wider embrac of nontradit relationship style and the pandem may even be play a part
but while interest in open relationship may be climb expert are mix on how wide their uptak may actual be – at least for right now
'free passes' and swingingther are mani way to engag in nonmonogami say levinson
“it could be anyth from live with multipl partner and share financ or it could be support your partner in onc a year have a free pass at a work confer out of state to have a hookup”open relationship fall under the nonmonogami umbrella but mani tend to differenti between those type of arrang and other type of nonmonogami like polyamori
polyamori often mean particip in multipl intim partnership while open relationship are more often associ with peopl engag in primarili sexual relationship outsid of their prioritis twoperson partnership
in other word open relationship are less focus on emot connect with peopl outsid a primari relationship and more on sexual onesopen relationship are gener associ with peopl engag in primarili sexual relationship outsid of their prioritis twoperson partnership credit getti imagesfor some thi mean go on casual date and have ‘friendswithbenefits’typ relationship with peopl other than their primari partner
for other an open relationship just mean that occasion “free pass” to have a onenight stand or brief sexual fling
and for other still the arrang could look more like swing – such as have sex with other coupl as a coupl but not go on date separ
winston also bring up “don’t ask don’t tell”styl open relationship in which both member of a coupl permit the other to have sexual relat with other peopl – they just don’t want to discuss those experi togetheroth term like “monogamish” which usbas relationship and sex columnist dan savag popularis sever year ago can overlap definit with some of these openrelationship arrang
savag ha discuss hi monogamish relationship on hi podcast in which he and hi partner are commit to each other but still have noncommitt sex with other men
peopl of all stripe are engag in open relationship
over the past few year levinson say she’ been see “quit a bit of diversity” among those particip in open relationship in her session in term of everyth from “econom resources” to “ethnicity”
howev she acknowledg that as a counsellor work in new york citi she get to see a differ sampl than one might come across in other more conserv part of the us
among winston’ client base podcast listen and websit visitor she’ found mani who are interest or particip in open relationship tend to skew rel young – between the age of 25 and 45
and mani identifi as queer bisexu andor pansexu
howev in her practic she’ work with client interest in or practic open relationship who are as young as 19 and as old as in their 70
“the peopl who come to my door complet span the spectrum” she says‘get curious’ datingapp trend help highlight the rise in interest in open relationship
for one there ha been an emerg of platform particularli focus on nonmonogami includ open relationship to cater to rise curios
but even more tradit date app such as okcupid have seen a spike in interest in open relationship
“while the major of okcupid dater seek monogam relationship in 2021 user seek nonmonogam relationship increas 7” an okcupid repres told bbc worklif
among more than 1 million ukbas okcupid user who respond to the question ‘would you consid have an open relationship’ in the app 31 percent said ye in 2022 compar to 29 in 2021 and 26 in 2020addit 2022 data from date app hing show one in five hing user “would consider” tri out an open relationship while one in 10 have alreadi engag in one
hinge’ director of relationship scienc logan uri say there may be a pandem effect sinc she believ it wa “the perfect opportun to paus and think more about what we want”counsellor and profession includ levinson and winston have also observ an uptick
winston say that much of the recent interest she’ seen in open relationship come from millenni who are simpli “question the way they’v been raised” – in most case to believ that longterm marri monogami is the end goal of intim relationshipsthi may stem from an overal trend toward open minded believ levinson
“societ we are all more open mind to all sort of ident that are less conventional… peopl are more will to challeng societ construct in a gener way” thi ha open the door for peopl to question their own desir too
when “you keep choos monogami and it' not working… you start get curiou about whether there’ anoth way”and for those who are curiou there are more resourc than ever
along with the “explos of interest” in open relationship add winston there’ an “explos in content creator and peopl write about it in media… in app in commun meetups”
thi mean inform about nonmonogami is wide access – not in “old dusti livejourn person onlin journal in the corner of the internet” which is where winston say she need to look for inform more than a decad ago
more fantasi than realitydespit more peopl embrac nonmonogam arrang and a rise visibl around open relationship the gener percept still lean neg
“research and public opinion poll suggest that attitud toward consensu nonmonogami are mostli neg overal although they appear to have trend more posit in recent years” say dr justin lehmil kinsey institut research fellow and host of the sex and psycholog podcast
while those neg attitud may not stop peopl from think about be in open relationship it can deter them from engag in them
in hi research about sexual fantasi for instanc lehmil ha found that “most peopl have fantasis about be nonmonogam in some way befor such as by particip in swing open up their relationship or be polyamorous”
howev he add “rel few are practis it in real life”
although there is no postpandem data on how mani peopl are in these arrang canadian research from 2019 put the figur at about 4 with a similar figur emerg in a 2018 us studyeven if an increas number of peopl are engag in open relationship the subject may remain taboo say some expert credit getti imageslevinson believ thi may in part stem from an entrench percept that open relationship are broadli seen as ‘unhealthy’
among her therapist colleagu levinson ha observ that plenti still view the “dyad” or “coupl bubble” as the “onli workabl way of have a secur attachment” she say
she feel these attitud can “cut into peopl feel like thi is a viabl option for them”
religi belief can also deter peopl from engag in sexual andor date relationship with more than one person at a time as can the cultur norm of certain commun
even so winston see peopl particularli millenni and gen z continu to move away from the idea that one partner can fulfil all their need someth the tradit monogam concept of marriag encourag
she point to more platon friend decid to live togeth and copar as well as declin marriag rate to suggest a possibl futur societ shift in the way peopl engag in relationship
“peopl are branch out more into creat the relationship that make the most sens for their lives” she say
while levinson agre there will be a continu increas in “creativ relationship structures” for similar reason she doesn’t think it will becom a global phenomenon
too mani cultur around the world present challeng to peopl hope to open their relationship and the taboo remain global preval
okcupid’ head of global commun michael kay ha a differ view
“the behaviour we see among dater today have been around forev

worklife,"as 2022 come to a close we'r bring back our favourit piec of the year
see the rest of our best of worklif 2022 collect for more great readswhen laura wa invit for a finalstag interview at a multin music corpor base in london she thought she wa on the cusp of land her dream role
after pass a firstround phone interview and meet team member in person all laura had to do wa meet a seniorlevel execut
“it wa present to me as a formality” she say
“the interview went well and i wa later told i’d got the job”and then – noth
despit receiv initi guarante she would be join the team the email formal confirm laura' role never arriv
she’d send occasion followup to the firm’ hr depart onli to receiv noncommitt repli
“it wa alway me instig the conversation” say laura
“the last messag i receiv said they promis to contact me as soon as they had more inform on my new role
i never heard from them again”laura had been ghost
rather than send her a formal reject or an explan of what had happen her potenti employ ignor her
it’ a practic that’ common in the recruit process one recent studi of 1500 global worker found that 75 of jobseek have been ghost by a compani after a job interview
employ openli acknowledg that they do it onli 27 of us employ survey by job list site inde said they hadn’t ghost a candid in the past yearbut it’ not just compani
right now employe are ghost back – and potenti in higher number than ever befor
in the same 2021 inde survey 28 of worker said that they’d ghost an employ – compar to 19 two year befor
the phenomenon seem to be happen at all stage of the recruit process
while some employ report that candid cut off commun follow an initi phone screen a quarter said new hire had “noshowed” on their first day at workghost is consid bad practic for both compani and worker no one like be on the receiv end of it
yet it rise seem inexor digit hire process delug compani with candid make repli to everyon hard even as labour shortag give jobhunt more option as employ scrambl for talent
is the inevit consequ of thi an increasingli discourt recruit process – or can step be taken by both side to avert a downward spiraleasi – but more impersonal‘ghosting’ wa origin coin in the date world it meant a sudden unexpect end to all contact
it’ a social phenomenon increasingli be coopt in the workplac – and put into practic on either side of the interview tableb abl to suddenli drop commun dure the recruit process gener favour the parti in the more power posit
tradit employ have been more like to ghost than the workforc
howev even befor covid19 ghost had becom a grow trend among candid too thank to a tighten job market they could afford to begin mimick companies’ behaviourbut the pandem ha act as a catalyst fuell the current spike
yuletta pringl of the societi for human resourc manag base in virginia us say the rise is come from both worker and employ
pringl attribut the uptick to the fallout from the great resign
“labour shortag have left employ pinch and desper to hire mean they have to push out a ton of feeler onlin and may not be abl to respond to everyone” she explain
“on the employe side there are so mani job vacanc – they may be ghost potenti employ as they search for their ideal role and move around the recruit process”in mani case recruit process have been digitis
jobsearch algorithm place the open posit right in front of worker
‘easi apply’ option mean candid can send off resum for multipl job more effortlessli than ever
virtual interview have improv access increas opportun for employ and worker to find the best fit
“befor the pandem onli a fraction of interview broker through us would be done virtually” say craig freedberg a region director at recruit firm robert half base in london
“now 99 of our firststag interview are via zoom calls”howev the conveni of digitis and virtual recruit come at a cost
employ are have to both widen their net and interview more peopl as a result of the hire crisi
that creat a knockon effect for hire manag who whether insid firm or at extern recruit compani are deal with a glut of applic and role
“much of the ghost we’r see today may simpli be the fact that someon just can’t get back to everyone” say pringl
the loss of inperson interview may also be a factor in ghost by both parti
“it can sometim be harder to build a rapport with someon virtually” say freedberg
“the emot invest of travel to meet someon for an inperson interview is difficult to replic when you’r click on a calendar link from home and it’ easier for employ to ghost when you’r lose that human facetofac element”th process can therefor feel increasingli transact
and in the current buoyant job market applic may well be swamp too
“candid are be approach all the time with an abund of job to choos from” say freedberg
“if they have multipl applic on the go it can be easier to simpli ignor one of them”from the recruiters' end an explos of candid due to new digit recruit may mean applic find themselv wait for email that never come credit getti imagesbalanc ghost and profession market condit may well mean that not repli to everi lead or candid is becom more normalis
but ghost come with downsid to both employ and candid it leav a bad impress – like end a profession relationship befor it’ even begunfor that reason some compani particularli relationshipl one remain staunchli antighost – even if they’v been on the receiv end themselv
“in our industri it’ veri import to be approach and build strong relationship so we’r certainli antighosting” say christoph hardt founder of consult marketplac comatch base in berlin
“nevertheless we’r see more of our request to consult go unansw
that can be seen as unprofession but it’ a consequ of the current market a worker may ghost simpli becaus they’r too busy”pringl suggest that both employ and worker could benefit from think about what constitut ghost and where thi stray into unprofession
“if you have a job post and through your digit process you push out your vacanc to hundr of candid but don't repli to each one individu is that ghost
or would ghost be onc you'v made some contact both way and then commun drop
it would be help to defin it first”lik it date namesak freedberg believ that interview ghost is root in a lack of commit
“a precursor to ghost is when either parti doesn’t feel bought into the process or ha that emot investment” he say
“there ha to be greater emphasi on approach peopl you genuin think are right for the job
and if someon take time out of their day for an interview virtual or in person they deserv feedback”pringl believ respons for commun still fall on the employer’ side – and say the right kind of commun can limit the prospect of ghost from the outset
“if the employ is as clear and specif on the requir of the posit as possibl right at the begin of the hire process then that could help reduc ghost on the employees’ side” she sayskeep in touch with candid dure the recruit process is also import stress freedberg
“much of the time it’ just about manag expectations” he say
“if there are delay to the recruit process on either side respond to people’ email and let them know will alway be consid good practice”but worker have respons too
freedberg suggest that rather than appli for job on autopilot worker mind select posit that offer a good cultur fit
otherwis they risk wast recruiters’ time
“if a candid agre to meet an employ for an interview then decid to ghost then that’ someth a client won’t be happi with” he add
“it’ just bad practice”gener speak for both side the rule of thumb seem to be that the further you go down the recruit process the less accept it is to ghost
the more effort an applic or a compani ha invest in the recruit process the ruder an abrupt end to contact will feel
inevit it will leav a bad impress – as wa the case for laurain the end she never receiv a reject email
instead the delay doubt and ghost she experienc inflict a deeper psycholog blow – one that caus her to rethink her entir career
“i’d rather have just been told that for whatev reason i didn’t get the job” she say
“there were no excus to ghost me i’d invest so much time and energi reach that point onli for them to drop off the face of the earth”
