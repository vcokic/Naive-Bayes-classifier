culture,"The word ""minimalist"" elicits mixed reactions.
From the 1990s, it has been used by many as a derogatory term.
Even ardent design fans associate it with soulless interiors and a humourless reverence for design that prioritises aesthetics over comfort, or simply regard it as impractical, given all the stuff many of us inevitably accumulate.
In recent years, some designers have even gone to the other extreme, cultivating maximalism, welcomed by many as a joyful, exuberant antidote to uptight minimalism.
Floral wallpapers and rich, intense colours became popular in interiors crammed with contrasting textures and an eclectic mix of furniture, artworks and curios.More like this:-          Origins of the de-cluttered home-          Inside Japan's most minimalist homes-          Five ways to be calm and why it mattersBut there's a happy medium to be found between these two extremes.
We're now witnessing a return to more restrained, uncluttered interiors – but with a more relaxed, comfortable feel.
One indication of this is paint colours, which are moving away from maximalism's dramatic, even oppressive hues, such as navy or bottle green, to paler, earthier mid-tones like sandy beige and sage green that arguably make rooms feel more spacious.
Perhaps lockdowns, which reawakened an interest in nature, helped foster this taste for a palette inspired by the great outdoors.
A perception of maximalism as excessive and wasteful in the light of growing environmental concerns might have also sparked a trend for more clean-lined homes.Pops of colour and display shelving help provide both character and a sense of order (Credit: Betsy Smith)""People now want a simpler life partly because they're more conscious of sustainability,"" says Betsy Smith, an interiors stylist and colour consultant for Graphenstone Paints, who dubs her taste ""relaxed minimalism"".
She tells BBC Culture: ""As we're becoming more informed about what we buy, our interiors are becoming more considered.
We're using fewer elements to curate a comfortable, practical, stylish home.""
The 1990s vogue for radically minimalist interiors sprung from early 20th-Century modernism and a zero tolerance, among some of its exponents, for extraneous elements.
Technological advances in reinforced concrete and steel frames obviated the need for internal load-bearing walls, resulting in spacious, open-plan interiors.
A seminal example is Dutch architect and designer Gerrit Rietveld's Schröder House of 1924.
Comprising intersecting vertical and horizontal rectangular planes, its interiors were open-plan and devoid of ornament.
And German architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe advocated extreme simplicity with his German Pavilion created in 1929 for the International Exposition in Barcelona and cuboid Tugendhat House in the Czech Republic, built in 1930.Yet aspects of these seemingly severe buildings are influencing today's warm minimalism trend.
These include a strong connection between their interiors and surrounding landscape thanks to their expansive glazing.
A graceful willow tree stands outside the dining area of Tugendhat House.Another modernist element inspiring architects of minimalist homes today is the rich palette of materials favoured by Van der Rohe.
For the German Pavilion, he created two luxurious, leather-covered seats – still in production – for use by the visiting King and Queen of Spain.
""Minimalism, born out of early 20th-Century modernism, was in many ways a reaction against over-decorated, over-furnished high-Victorian interiors,"" says James Gorst, founder of James Gorst Architects.
""At Tugenhadt, Van der Rohe deployed a palette of richly veined marbles, exotic veneers, fabrics and rugs to animate and soften its essentially white interiors.
""Gorst says his project, Sandpipers, a house in rural Surrey, which boasts many floor-to-ceiling windows, channels this aesthetic: ""Its transparency opens itself confidently to the outside world with the exterior landscape replacing the stencilled wallpapers of the 19th Century.
Its walls are white, its flooring made of bare polished concrete and the window frames are metal.
Yet its interior is warm, thanks to oak panelling, paintings and leather-covered furniture, such as the LC1 chair, co-designed by modernists Le Corbusier, Charlotte Perriand and Pierre Jeanneret.
""Oak panelling and leather-covered furniture create a warm feel in a house in rural Surrey, UK (Credit: Gorst Architects)Danish interior design studio Space Copenhagen also links indoors and out when dreaming up minimalist interiors.
""We prefer sheer fabrics for curtains and blinds that allow for outside daylight to filter softly into spaces,"" says Signe Bindslev Henriksen, co-founder of the company, who sums up its style as ""poetic modernism"".
She tells BBC Culture: ""Translucency avoids creating a hard boundary between inside and outside.
Overall, we choose natural, tactile, organic materials – wood, stone, leather, linen, warm-toned metals and exposed plaster – and subdued, earthy colour tones.
""For David Montalba, founder of Montalba Architects, which has offices in Los Angeles and Lausanne, Switzerland, integrating views of the surrounding landscape into a minimalist home is essential to making it feel warm.
""The landscape can be a house's rural setting or a courtyard with paving and planting, as found within a triple-height atrium at our project Vertical Courtyard House in LA,"" says Montalba, who grew up in Switzerland and the Carmel area of California.
He is influenced by the Southern Californian regionalist architecture of Irving Gill, whose early 20th-Century houses featured simple interiors, plain fireplaces and skylights, and George Brook-Kothlow, who incorporated an abundance of wood into his houses.
""Engaging with the outdoors helps soften a minimalist home, as do bookshelves, art and textiles.
In one living space at Vertical Courtyard House, a wall-hung textile piece by Canadian artist Brent Wadden adds warmth and texture.
""Comfort zoneAnd interior designer Rukmini Patel has created a warmly minimalist living room for a home in Stratford-upon-Avon, using colours and materials inspired by nature.
""My client, who has a house with a garden, expressed a wish for the interior to connect with the outdoors,"" she says.
""When creating a cosy minimalist home, I feel it's important to use a multitude of natural materials, textures and colours that engage the senses.
For the living room I chose autumnal tones – rust, burnt orange and olive green – and wicker and wood to evoke nature.
I opted for wood flooring, echoing this with wood, rather than colder metal or glass furniture, and a warm peachy cream shade for the walls.
I also plumped for a thick, tactile Berber rug that is calming and relaxing when you sink your feet into it.""
Smith believes a warmly minimalist interior can be achieved simply by combining a limited number of contrasting textures: ""Play with the juxtaposition of opposites as transitioning from one to the other heightens the senses.
Imagine walking barefoot on a hard smooth floor, then stepping on to a soft textured rug, and the feeling of warmth and luxury that brings.
""Interior designer Rukmini Patel created a ""cosy minimalist"" interior with rattan and wood details (Credit: Megan Taylor)Bathrooms can look especially cold due to their hard surfaces but subtle touches can warm them up.
For an understated bathroom in a Victorian home in Hampstead, Katy Manolescue, founder of Article Design Studio, chose nuanced, pale tones, such as ""clotted cream, biscuit and stone"", while vanity units were topped with speckled terrazzo that enlivens the space.
Tiles with a warm white glaze were paired with biscuit-toned grout for a warmer look, while pewter and bronze fittings were chosen instead of chilly-looking silver finishes.Smith advises choosing neutral paint colours, but judiciously: ""Minimal interiors are typically neutral and airy, creating a relaxing environment.
But neutral paints are often more challenging to get right than more saturated hues.
It's essential to get the right undertone when selecting a neutral paint colour as this impacts on a room's atmosphere.
Neutrals with a red undertone work well in light-deprived spaces as they warm them up.
They also accentuate the beauty of natural materials, such as stone and leather.
Standard pure brilliant whites tinged with a cold blue tone are overly stark and should be avoided.
""Yet Smith believes minimalism and accents of bright colour aren't mutually exclusive: ""Introduce strong colour, albeit sparingly,"" she counsels.
""Opt for a single statement piece of furniture like a mustard or orange upholstered sofa, which instantly adds warmth.
Coloured chairs around a table make a dining area inviting.""
That said, she adds, bulky unused furniture make a space look lifeless.
""A large dining table is great when it's a hive of activity but makes a space feel empty if unoccupied.
I arrange pieces, such as ceramics, on mine when it's not used so it looks less static.
""According to Smith, the modern minimalist home needn't exclude visible ""objects or belongings"", although she advises displaying them in an ordered fashion.
""I've used a giant grid of pigeonholes to show my collection of objects, which ties everything into one focused statement.
I also like a single shelf with a collection of objects displayed in a linear row.
Placing a shelf high up in an unexpected place, such as above a doorway, adds an element of surprise and humour in minimal settings.
""Interior designers and architects also recommend including vintage furniture in rooms for a cosy feel.
""Mid-century furniture creates a welcome sense of familiarity and nostalgia,"" says Montalba.
""In the entrance hall of Vertical Courtyard House is a bench by French modernist architect Jean Prouvé.
""The Vertical Courtyard House in LA has a light, airy aesthetic but also has character (Credit: Montalba Architects)Many designers believe lighting is a vital ingredient in warmly minimalist interiors.
""Lighting completely changes a minimal space's ambience,"" says Smith.
""Fragmented light projected through perforated metal or woven-cane lampshades becomes magical in pared-back interiors, adding subtle, ever-changing animation throughout the day.
""It may have seemed, not long ago, that reductive, stripped-down minimalist interiors had no future, that they represented a stylistic cul-de-sac.

Saint OmerWhy would anyone kill their own baby?
Alice Diop asked herself that question in 2016, when she was watching the trial of a French-Senegalese woman who had left her child on a beach to drown.
Having made a name for herself as a documentary filmmaker, Diop has turned her memories of the trial into a gripping drama, Saint Omer.
Kayije Kagame plays Rama, a pregnant, Diop-like novelist who plans to use the case in her book on the Greek myth of the child-killing Medea.
Guslagie Malanda plays Laurence Coly, the complex woman on trial.
""Diop consciously uses the many tropes of true crime documentaries,"" says Sheila O'Malley at RogerEbert.com, ""while at the same time up-ending them.
In doing so, Saint Omer becomes a much larger reflection on contemporary French life, the experience of immigrants, and the shadows we drag along with us as we move into a different space.

Women TalkingWomen Talking has just been nominated for best picture and best adapted screenplay at this year's Oscars.
Written and directed by Sarah Polley, and drawing from Miriam Toew's 2018 fact-based novel, the film features Claire Foy, Jessie Buckley, Rooney Mara and a cameo-ing Frances McDormand as the residents of a remote religious community where the men have been drugging and raping the women for years.
When the crimes finally come to light, the women have to decide what to do: forgive their attackers, fight for justice, or leave the community, even if that means, according to what they've been taught, that they will lose their chance of going to heaven.
Lindsey Bahr at Associated Press says that Polley's ""extraordinary"" film ""is expressionistic and lyrical, biting and poetic.
The conversations are messy, the feminism contradictory and the trauma complicated...
It is astute and urgent and may just help those previously unable to find words or even coherent feelings for their own traumatic experiences.

BrokerHirokazu Kore-Eda has written and directed a huge number of beautifully humane films, including 2018's award-winning Shoplifters, but Broker could be his most delightful.
Set in South Korea, its unlikely hero (Song Kang-ho, the star of Parasite) is a launderette owner with a shocking sideline: he takes infants from a church's ""baby box"", a hatch where people can leave unwanted children, and then sells those infants to would-be adoptive parents.
However, police detectives are watching him, and so is the young mother of the latest child he is selling.
As dark as this premise may sound, Broker becomes a funny, big-hearted road movie about a group of loners becoming a family.
""There's an astonishing sympathy for the unforgivable decisions we make, a patience for all the strange journeys you have to take in order to shake off the resentment passed down by generations,"" says Ella Kemp at IndieWire.
""And, somehow, the filmmaker always finds a way to see light in it all.

Pamela, A Love StoryLast year's Disney+ drama series, Pam & Tommy, recounted how Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee's honeymoon sex tape was stolen, copied, and distributed around the world.
The series seemed to support Anderson, but it was made without her cooperation, and so on one level the producers were perpetuating the very exploitation they claimed to be condemning.
As Laura Martin put it in her BBC Culture review: ""It feels like grubby stuff that, sadly, has facilitated the real-life victim being unwantedly pushed back into the headlines for an episode she'd likely rather forget.""
Now, an intimate documentary from Ryan White, the director of Serena and Good Night Oppy, allows Anderson to present her life the way she wants to – as well as allowing Netflix to take the moral high ground from Disney+.
""I blocked that stolen tape out of my life in order to survive, and now that it's all coming back again, I feel sick,"" says Anderson in the trailer for Pamela, A Love Story.
""I want to take control of the narrative for the first time.

Blue JeanIn 1988, Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government introduced Clause 28 in the UK, a law banning local authorities from ""promoting homosexuality"" and schools from ""teaching homosexuality as a pretended family relationship"".
It's a nerve-racking time for Jean (Rosy McEwan), the heroine of Georgia Oakley's Bafta-nominated drama.
A PE teacher in a happy same-sex relationship, Jean prefers to keep her sexuality secret at school.
But when a new pupil, Lois (Lucy Halliday), spots her in a lesbian bar, she fears that the secret will come out.
""This superb debut from writer and director Georgia Oakley uses an intimate character study as a lens through which to view a period of profound crisis and upheaval for the gay community,"" writes Wendy Ide in Screen Daily.
""It's a remarkably accomplished picture on every level, not least the keenly felt and fiercely authentic performances.

Magic Mike's Last DanceChanning Tatum shows off his abs again for the third and final film in his male stripper series, directed, as the first film was, by Steven Soderbergh.
Tatum's character, Mike Lane, has been working as a bartender in Miami since the events of Magic Mike XXL (2015), but after he demonstrates his lap-dancing prowess to a wealthy socialite (Salma Hayek Pinault), she talks him into putting on a burlesque revue in London.
Magic Mike's Last Dance is inspired by a real stage show, Magic Mike Live London, which was created by Tatum in 2018.
But it was also prompted by his desire to give Mike a powerful female counterpart.
""Really, the first two movies are about men made for women, or people that like men, but none of them had really strong female characters,"" he told Jessica Pressler in Vanity Fair, ""so it felt like we hoodwinked people on some level.
Like we cheated the code.

Ant-Man and The Wasp: QuantumaniaThe first two Ant-Man films were small-scale in more ways than one.
They were carried by the charm of their leading man, Paul Rudd, but they were trifling and forgettable: can anyone remember who the villain was in 2018's Ant-Man and the Wasp?
The series' director, Peyton Reed, promises that the third Ant-Man film will be different.
Instead of a light-hearted comedy caper confined to San Francisco, he has made an epic adventure set in a microscopic universe ruled by the time-travelling Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors).
""People felt like, 'Oh, these are fun little palate cleansers after a gigantic Avengers movie',"" Reed told Clark Collis of EW.
""For this third one, I said, 'I don't want to be the palate cleanser anymore.
I want to be the big Avengers movie' ...
It struck me as interesting to take the tiniest Avengers – in some people's minds maybe the least powerful Avengers — and put them up against the most powerful force in the multiverse.

Knock at the CabinIf US cinema has taught us anything, it's that going on holiday to a cabin in the woods is always a terrible idea.
The latest person to teach us this lesson is M Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense, Signs), who has adapted his apocalyptic chiller from Paul Tremblay's nightmarish horror novel, The Cabin at the End of the World.
In this instance, the people foolish enough to stay in a secluded cabin are a girl (Kristen Cui) and her parents (Jonathan Groff and Ben Aldridge).
Four strangers (Dave Bautista, Rupert Grint, Nikki Amuka-Bird, Abby Quinn) come to their door and announce that one member of the family has to be sacrificed, or else the human race will be wiped out.
The weird part is that the strangers could well be telling the truth.
""It's a wonderful discussion that we're all going to have when you watch the movie,"" Shyamalan said to Jamie Graham in Total Film.
""Is humanity worth saving?
Are we good?
The human experiment – is this working?

Cocaine BearVery, very loosely based on a true story, Cocaine Bear is a horror comedy set in 1985, when a drug dealer throws a duffel bag of cocaine out of his plane.
The plan is that one of his employees will collect the bag, but a black bear swallows its contents first, and rampages through a Georgia forest in a drug-crazed frenzy.
Potentially the most fun film about ursine-related chaos since Paddington 2, Cocaine Bear stars Keri Russell, O'Shea Jackson, Alden Ehrenreich and the late Ray Liotta as the unlucky hikers and gangsters who are in the forest at the time.
It's directed by Elizabeth Banks (Pitch Perfect 2, Charlie's Angels), who told Peter Gray at the AU Review: ""I love characters who are funny and underdogs.
I think when you're up against a bear high on cocaine it doesn't matter who you are.
You're an underdog in that scenario.

The other is The Amazing Maurice, adapted from Terry Pratchett's award-winning children's novel, and featuring Hugh Laurie as the voice of the titular feline.
Maurice is the brains behind a Pied Piper-related con.
Whenever he finds a promising-looking village, he instructs his faithful gang of rats (including one voiced by David Tennant) to run riot, whereupon his mild-mannered human pal, Keith (Himesh Patel), offers to deal with the rodent infestation.
The trouble begins when they come to a town that already has its own genuine rat problem, and its own genuine ratcatchers – or so it seems.

Your Place or Mine promises to be an archetypal Hollywood romantic comedy, from its premise to its cast to its writer-director, Aline Brosh McKenna (27 Dresses).

culture,"""How long Colette has lived, even after her death!""
wrote the journalist Janet Flanner in 1967.
More than half a century later, Colette lives on still, and this week sees the 150th anniversary of her birth.
To mark the occasion, NYRB Classics has published a new translation of her twin masterpieces, Chéri (1920) and The End of Chéri (1926), translated by Paul Eprile – and this seems like a good opportunity to explore the life and work of this uniquely beloved of French writers.More like this:-       America's greatest living writer?-       Why the most difficult novel is so rewarding-       The shocking memoir of the 'lost generation'Colette's fame extends to being probably the only female writer known by her mononym – she is always and only Colette, though in fact this most feminine of names was her surname: she was born Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette on 28 January 1873 in the French village of Saint-Sauveur-en-Puisaye.Her work – mostly at novella length, short and sharp – survives because her chief subject is one that never goes out of fashion.
""Love, the bread and butter of my pen,"" she wrote, though she put it more bluntly in her book The Pure and the Impure (1932): ""The flesh, always the flesh, the mysteries and betrayals and frustrations and surprises of the flesh.""
André Gide, that great connection point for 20th-Century French literature, agreed, praising Chéri for its ""intelligence, mastery and understanding of the least-admitted secrets of the flesh"".The story of Colette and her work is one of the most astonishing in modern literature.
She was a pioneer of the French school of autofiction (autobiographical fiction), writing about women's lives in ways that broke new ground.
Her books were simultaneously popular and acclaimed – read by critics and the public alike – not to mention scandalous.
And she made of her life a project just as fascinating as her books.
But to understand her – her fertile productivity, her showiness, her expertise in the mysteries of the human heart, and her appetite for including herself in her books, disguised either lightly or not at all – we must first understand that she almost didn’t become famous in the first place.A runaway success Her first four books were the chronicles of fictional French schoolgirl Claudine – Claudine at School (1900), Claudine in Paris (1901), Claudine Married (1902) and Claudine and Annie (1903) – which she wrote at the behest of her first husband Henry Gauthier-Villars, a journalist and editor known by the less elegant pen-name of Willy.
Once she wrote them – at times locked in a room to spur her to completion – and they were garnished with a few editorial suggestions by Willy (""Some girlish high jinks… you see what I mean?
""), Willy had them published under his own name and kept the copyright and royalties.Colette's first husband ""Willy"" published her first books under his name, keeping the copyrights and royalties (Credit: Alamy)In reports about Colette's life, the usual word to describe Willy is ""deplorable"", and so he was, but he did give Colette a taste for Parisian cultural life – she met Marcel Proust, Maurice Ravel, Claude Debussy and more – and did his bit to boost the sales of ""his"" books, which were slow until he arranged for three of his friends to write favourable reviews.
Soon Claudine at School took off, and by the time the series was complete, the books were so popular they spawned stage productions and a range of merchandise, including Claudine cigarettes.The books are apprentice work by definition – Colette wrote them in her twenties, under duress – but for a writer who started reading Balzac at the age of seven, that is no criticism.
Claudine became what Colette's biographer Judith Thurman called ""the century's first teenager"", with her sponge-like absorption of adult behaviour, and in the books we see the development of Colette's mastery of sensuous description, as well as her first ransackings of her own life for material (which can make reading the wedding night scene in Claudine Married a somewhat voyeuristic experience).
It was in these books, too, that we saw Colette's first handling of love in fiction – although Claudine in Paris is probably the last book where Colette would write about love uncritically, romantically, without the power dynamics and ambiguity that made her later work so piquant.
(""Men are terrible,"" she once wrote, adding, ""Women, too.
"")Colette and Willy separated in 1906, and the following year she published (under the name Colette Willy) Retreat from Love, which continued the story of Claudine and Annie, and which she prefaced with the declaration: ""For reasons which have nothing to do with literature, I have ceased to collaborate with Willy.""
She was free at last.Colette as le petit Faune in Le Desire, La Chimere et L'Amour, c 1906 – her experience in music hall inspired her 1910 novel, The Vagabond (Credit: Alamy)However, with Willy still retaining the royalties from the Claudine books, Colette was penniless, and to earn money she became a music hall performer.
This appealed to her sense of performance and enabled her to play with gender roles: one minute dressed in drag as a besuited man, the next posing with a bare breast in the bodice-ripping pantomime The Flesh.
Her experience in music hall inspired her 1910 novel The Vagabond, the highly autobiographical story of performer Renée Néré and a lover she calls ""the Big Noodle"", which asks modern questions about the separation of love and sex, and how society seeks to control both through the institution of marriage.
(An institution about which, of course, Colette and therefore Renée had great scepticism.)
It was The Vagabond that catapulted Colette to literary acclaim for the first time, and the book won three votes for the prestigious Prix Goncourt.Writing 'immoral' booksColette's time in music hall might have galvanised her interest in putting herself centre-stage in her fiction.
One of her finest examples of this is the late novel Chance Acquaintances (1940), in which Colette the narrator visits a health resort where wealthy women (with fashionably bobbed hair) undergo dubious cures: ""nasal douches, steam rooms, flushing the kidneys"".
There she meets a husband and wife, the Haumes.
Mme Haume is unwell, while M Haume has the appearance of ""someone with very few thoughts in his head"".
Colette discovers, however, that M Haume is having an affair and that his lover, back in Paris, has gone silent on him.
Naturally, this is Colette's ideal territory, and she agrees to visit his lover in Paris to find out the true story.
The plot shows Colette's appetite for mischief, as well as her enduring interest in the vagaries of the human heart, while M Haume finds that ""when intrigue is called into play, a woman never forgets that feminine instinct is the older in guile.
""After Willy, Colette's second husband, Henry de Jouvenel, could only be an improvement, and as editor of leading newspaper Le Matin, he was also able to publish his wife’s work.
But even this came unstuck, as he was forced to abandon the serialised publication of a new book, Ripening Seed (1923), due to the shock it caused readers, and he asked her why she could not write novels that were not immoral.Colette had relationships with women as well as men, including Mathilde de Morny, the niece of Napoleon (pictured) (Credit: Alamy)Ripening Seed was the novel that extended Colette's interest in love, power and sexuality to the crimson red period of adolescence, through teenage friends Philip (impatient to be older) and Vinca (with her eyes of ""white and periwinkle blue"").
They have been “15 years together as pure and loving twins"" and seem likely to develop their friendship, though Philip will find that ""possession is a miracle not so speedily accomplished.""
But their simple relationship is complicated when Philip is seduced by an older woman: and this too came from life, as at the age of 47 Colette had a relationship with her 16-year-old stepson, Bertrand de Jouvenel.
Ripening Seed is a highly sensual novel, revelling in not just bodily pleasures (""ripe lips like fruit scorched by the heat of the day""), but in the smells and sights of the seaside landscape on the Brittany coast.
Ripening Seed was published between Colette's greatest artistic achievements, Chéri and The End of Chéri.
The first book tells of an ageing courtesan, Léa de Lonval, and Chéri, the ""very beautiful, very young"" man with ""hair like the plumage of a blackbird"" and ""firmly muscled chest"" whom she has been educating in the field of love for a number of years.
The complications, as ever, arise when Léa decides that it is time for her Chéri to move on.
The novelist Amy Bloom called Chéri a ""book about the importance of love, the failure of love [and] the way people in love often manage to fail themselves as well as their beloveds"".
In the closing lines of Chéri, our hero is ""filling his lungs with air like an escapee"".
But he is not done with her yet: the companion piece, The End of Chéri, warns us of its ambiguity from the opening lines as Chéri leaves his home, having not thought about Léa for years (""'Ah!
It's nice out'.
He changed his mind at once.
'No it's not.'"").
And when he enters a society apartment, finding an overweight old woman with ""upper arms as fat as thighs"", he recognises her laugh – and we know that all will not end well this time.
""Full of life and laughter""When she published The End of Chéri, Colette was 53 years old, with great works still to come.
The Pure and the Impure, which she considered would one day be regarded as her best book, was a work of reminiscence on a theme of gender and sexuality: Colette had relationships with women as well as men, including Mathilde de Morny, the niece of Napoleon.
The book explores relations between men and women, women and women, and covers transvestism as well as homosexuality (or, as Colette puts it in her description of her friend Pauline Tarn, ""this poet who never ceased claiming kinship with Lesbos"").Colette's best-known book in the English-speaking world is Gigi (1944), which became a celebrated musical starring Audrey Hepburn, and a 1958 film (Credit: Alamy)But the work she became best known for in the English-speaking world was Gigi (1944), which had familiar elements – the story of a young woman and an older man (the reverse of Chéri), with the young woman being trained as a courtesan.
It was one of the last books she wrote, aged 70 and crippled with arthritis, and as a reaction to her circumstances she made it lighter, less cynical and more optimistic than much of her earlier work.
(It is perhaps these qualities that have made it so popular.)
Gigi became a celebrated stage musical and film; the stage production made a star of Audrey Hepburn, who was personally chosen by Colette for the role.Colette's acclaim in France was not always, at the time, matched abroad.
Time magazine in 1934 referred to Colette as a ""below-the-belt"" writer, having previously written that she was a ""purveyor to those who like mild aphrodisiacs in print"" (while acknowledging that this category included ""99.44% of all readers"").
Nonetheless, astute readers adored her, including Truman Capote, who puckishly told their mutual friend Jean Cocteau that Colette was the living French writer he most admired (including, that is, Cocteau).
Cocteau gallantly set up a meeting in 1947, though Capote – who described the encounter in his essay The White Rose – was so starstruck that he spent much of his time with Colette admiring her collection of antique crystal paperweights.Colette was a huge star in France; she was the first woman to be given a state funeral, after she died in 1954 (Credit: Getty Images)Back home in France, Colette was a star.
She was the second woman to be made a grand officer of the Legion of Honour, and the first to be given a state funeral, following her death in 1954 at the age of 81.
Her work did not trouble the reader with politics or world affairs.
Her canvas was what Tolstoy called ""man's most tormenting tragedy – the tragedy of the bedroom"".

culture,"Take a look at any episode of the old detective series Columbo and you'll see that the title's yellow letters and font are echoed precisely in Poker Face, created by Rian Johnson.
Columbo is its main touchstone, and like its inspiration, Poker Face is sly, easy, escapist fun.
But as he did in the character-driven whodunnit films Knives Out and Glass Onion, Johnson has designed this show with a shrewd sense of how to give nostalgia an update.
His throwback to murder-of-the-week shows works perfectly well today, although the shambolic hero played by Peter Falk is now a croaky-voiced heroine with wild hair and a mobile phone.
More like this: – 11 of the best TV shows to watch in January – The Last of Us is a 'remarkable' show – The reinvention of the murder mysteryNatasha Lyonne stars as Charlie, an accidental crime-solver with an unfailing ability to look someone in the eye and know when they're lying – a handy talent whether you're gambling at cards, her former profession, or running into murderers at every stop on the road, which is where the series takes her.
As in Columbo and plenty of Alfred Hitchcock Presents episodes, we first see the crime take place, and go on to watch how Charlie figures it all out.
""The real trick of it is figuring out why, why somebody is lying,"" she says.Lyonne has the same wry sensibility and delivery she has brought to other characters, most recently as the time-shifting heroine in the Netflix series Russian Doll.
But intuitive, kind-hearted Charlie may be the most likeable, least acerbic character she has ever played, someone who can wear well over the course of a series.
Following the Columbo pattern, she drives a beat-up car and is underestimated by criminals – played by a line -up of guest stars popping in for a single episode – who are taken in by her supposedly innocent, confused questions.
The sleek, involving first episode, written and directed by Johnson, is among the best.
The murder happens at a garish Las Vegas-like hotel and casino, and the episode is shot to look like a 1970s television show, with saturated colours and ominous music cues.
That playful look works once, then Johnson smartly drops it for more cinematic approaches in later instalments.
He knows how far to mimic a formula and when to throw it away.
(Other writers and directors take over, starting with episode three.
)When a hotel maid (Dasha Polanco) discovers a horrifying image on a guest's computer in that first story, she notifies the hotel manager, played with perfect smarminess by Adrien Brody.
Establishing the show's pattern, Charlie turns up about 20 minutes in and the timeline shifts back to before the murder, with scenes telling us why she was around in the first place.
Here she turns up as a cocktail waitress wearing a goofy feathered hat.It's enough to say that things go wrong and Charlie has to flee, with the casino's hitman, (Benjamin Bratt) chasing after her.
Bratt's character gives the series its slender continuity and a reason for Charlie to travel around under the radar, taking jobs as a waitress or a cleaner, trying to stay a step ahead of the killer.The guests are not mega movie stars, but familiar faces.
In one episode, Chloe Sevigny, who played Lyonne's character's mother in Russian Doll's flashbacks, stars as Ruby Ruin, a has-been singer in a metal band, now working at a warehouse.
She gets the band back together and goes on the road, with Charlie selling their T-shirts.
Like the Knives Out mysteries, Poker Face walks the line between straightforward and tongue-in-cheek, but where the films land on the campier side, the series is more invested in its plots.
No detail is too small or silly to be a clue or a red herring, including the title of the metal band's one hit, Staplehead.
Lil Rel Howery plays the co-owner of a Texas barbecue restaurant, whose brother wants to quit the business, saying, ""I'm going vegan"".
Wit always takes precedence over seriousness here.
Someone falls off a roof at a rest stop in New Mexico, where Charlie meets a trucker played by Hong Chau (The Whale).
She later works at a retirement home and befriends 1970s radicals gleefully played by Judith Light and S Epatha Merkerson.One other nostalgic touch: like those old series, Poker Face is not necessarily made to binge.
It's there, ready whenever you feel like a reassuring, cosy mystery that's more rumpled crime-solver than Miss Marple.★★★★☆Poker Face premieres on 26 January on Peacock in the US Love film and TV?

culture,"Nata Talikishvili never wanted to be a comedian.
With a career that ranges from sex worker to club bouncer, Talikishvili uses her acerbic humour to expose society's hypocrisy, telling true stories that make light of her own difficult experiences as a trans woman in the transphobic culture of Georgia.
She turns up to her interview with BBC Culture an hour late, waving a fan coquettishly, and her comic talent oozes out to such an extent that the translator keeps bursting into laughter during our conversation.More like this:-          How pop stars react when war breaks out-          The Scandinavian folk clothing for now-          The forgotten Soviet genius of musicOne of the main targets of her stories are the country's Orthodox priests, who according to Talikishvili are both key culprits in whipping up Georgian society's hatred, and at the same time, she jokes, make up a large chunk of her client base.
An annual march for family values organised by the Church is one of her busiest working days she says, because so many priests visit Tblisi from the countryside.
""I bless them in the morning and then send them to the demonstration,"" she quips.Comedian Nata Talikishvili uses her acerbic humour to highlight Georgian hypocrisy (Credit: David Koridze)In Georgia violent marches against LGBTQ+ people attract tens of thousands on to the streets, and hateful diatribes on TV and social media.
According to a recent survey, 84% of Georgians think same-sex relations are always wrong, making it, according to these survey results at least, one of the most homophobic countries in Europe, even more than neighbouring Turkey.Yet in the Georgian capital Tblisi there is a thriving, tight-knit underground LGBTQ+ scene, spearheaded by techno clubs such as Bassiani but also spreading into cinemas and galleries and onto stages.
Georgia's vibrant and hedonistic culture was moulded and repressed by the socially conservative Soviet Union that it became a part of in 1922 until its disbanding in 1991.
It is only now that people are reclaiming and reviving this heritage in Georgian culture and art.When Talikishvili was five, living in a remote Georgian village, she announced to the world that she was a girl.
In such a traditional and religious country, it was considered remarkable that her grandparents supported her decision and raised her happily as a girl.
But when they died, she had to move to the capital of Tblisi to make a living.
Aged just 14, she says she felt she had no option but to start sex work.Club-runner Giorgi Kikonishvili, shown here in the documentary Midnight Frontier, directed by Peter van Langen (Credit: Iris-saane van der Aar)""It was really difficult,"" she says, dropping her jokey manner for just a moment.
Many landlords refuse to rent to trans people, she explains, and so a lot are forced to live on the street.
There was even a lot of division among the trans sex workers.
""Back then it was wild, everyone was against each other.
I was just trying to survive.""
And though the red light district was far from safe, it was also the only place Talikishvil could express herself as a woman.On the street, things are now much safer for LGBTQ+ people in Georgia, but much of the public debate takes place on Facebook.
Someone will share a transphobic video saying that they will kill trans people and threatening their lives, says Talikishvi, then she will comment and post a screenshot of them asking her for sex.
""The videos usually disappear afterwards,"" she notes wryly.
""These men [clients] are not from an alien planet, they are part of Georgian society.
""Alongside sex work, Talikishvili worked for years as a club bouncer, earning just 60 lari (the equivalent of about £20) for a whole night shift, which could last until 11am.
""I did it to show the people who would come that there is nothing scary about being trans.
I did it as [a kind of] activism.
Even inside the queer community, and queer groups on social media, there was a lot of transphobia before.
The community has to overcome [that] because if even the queer community can't then who can.
""One evening while working as a bouncer at a club, she went inside to see some friends and started chatting and gossiping.
A crowd gathered organically, listening to her tales.
The club's owner went looking for Talikishvili, and when she saw the throng of people around her, she knew that she had to get Talikishvili on stage.
She is now performing fortnightly.
That club was Bassiani, a hub for Tblisi's underground scene.
""Our original goal was not just a techno club,"" says Giorgi Kikonishvili, founder of Georgia's first LGBTQ+ event, Horoom Nights at Bassiani, which started in 2016, ""but a kind of underground base for all sorts of social movements in Georgia… those of queers, women, the left, the green movement.
So the DNA of the club is not just music and techno, we see the club as a political place.
""Though named after an all-male Georgian martial dance, Khorumi, the nights, soundtracked by house and techno, wouldn't be out of place in Berlin.
Kikonishvili tells BBC Culture he was inspired by a huge homophobic counter-demonstration in 2013, when 20,000 protesters trapped him and about 30 other activists in a bus.
""I knew at that moment I had to emigrate or change my country.""
He opted for the latter, launching an array of cultural and political projects.
""Half of Georgian society now thinks gay people should be allowed to protest publicly,"" he says.
""Ten years ago we could have fitted all the people who thought that in this room.
""Bar owner and drag-show director Nia Gvatua is a central figure in Tblisi's thriving LGBTQ+ scene (Credit: James Jackson)During the day, Kikonishvili works with artist and activist Tekla Tevdorashvili and others at the Fungus Gallery, an LGBTQ+ art collective and gallery in a quiet corner of Tblisi that invites artists from across the Caucasus region.
Tevdorashvili says it is hard to understate the importance of club culture in these social changes.
""Nightlife changed the whole context of how Georgian society perceives queer people.
Clubs were the first place to offer them a safe space, and now the attitude people have in the clubs is shifting to daylight.
""Another hotspot for Tblisi nightlife is Success bar, the oldest gay bar in the entire Caucasus.
Its owner Nia Gvatua initially just wanted to redecorate the somewhat dingy place so that she could make it worth visiting for the local community.
Five years ago, after asking around, she was invited to meet with a local businessman, who proceeded to open his safe and gave her $20,000 cash on the spot.
She set about transforming the bar into a cultural hub.
""When I began, it was more about aesthetics.
I was really into electronic music for many years, so when I began, I was more focused on which DJs I wanted to book and what cocktails I wanted to make.""
A linchpin of the Tblisi LGBTQ+ scene who has shared style tips with Vogue, Gvatua documents the scene with photography, and directs drag shows at Success, Bassiani and other venues.Resistance and resilienceBut Tevdorashvili and others wanted to get involved in more than just clubs, so they set up Fungus, where they recently put on Resilience, a group exhibition of photography and multimedia art dedicated to trans women.
Named as such because fungus comes from the dark underground, Fungus's motto is ""we thrive wherever we get even a little chance to grow,"" and it's located next to Klara's bar, where Talikishvili performs fortnightly.
Though the reception from the locals was initially awkward, things have warmed up a lot recently, with one man coming recently to tell them ""respect from the neighbourhood!
"".For Tevdorashvili, this need for safe spaces is all too real.
A few years ago she put an art installation up in a public park days before the annual church-organised ""day for family purity"".
The installation was a rainbow-coloured box entitled ""Closet"", with handwritten notes from the LGBTQ+ community, which played a speech and then the Diana Ross song Coming Out.
She had only told a few trusted blogs about it in advance, but it was attacked by a far-right activist within just a few hours of being up.
Tevdorashvili recognised him from demonstrations.
The police came but they advised against putting the artwork back up.
This was a setback, she says, but not a defeat: ""What we artists and activists has gone through have only made us stronger.
""Kikonishvili agrees.
""It's not like homosexuality was invented in Georgia after the breakup of the Soviet Union,"" he laughs.
Though it was briefly made legal after the October revolution, Joseph Stalin (born in Georgia as Iosip Jugashvili) criminalised homosexuality again in 1934, with the strong support of author Maxim Gorky.
(The freedom of same-sex sexual activity was not officially enshrined in law in Georgia until 2000, and, of course, despite that legality, social acceptance has been another matter.
)Kikonishvili points to the Berikaoba festival, which he says is celebrated across the country by cross-dressing, drinking and feasting, as well as the popularity of gay Georgian cultural figures like the famed Tblisi-born director Sergei Parajanov and traditional dancer Vakhtang Chabukiani, as evidence of the shallow roots of contemporary homophobia in Georgia.
""Chabukiani is the most beloved Georgian dancer ever, and he was gay and everyone knew it.""
Parajanov, however, was persecuted by the Soviet authorities for his sexuality as much as for his subversive filmmaking.Sandwiched between Russia and Turkey, with its own alphabet, and a long history of visiting traders from the Silk Road, Georgia was known for scenes of hedonism at its sulphur baths in Tblisi, and has the oldest wine culture (viniculture) in the world.
David Apakidze is an art historian and co-curator of Fungus art collective and gallery (Credit: James Jackson)David Apakidze, co-curator of Fungus and art historian, agrees.
""We are trying to tell the true history of our art.
In the Soviet Union a lot of queer artists were hidden.
Some art researchers reclaimed them and took their art from archives, but no one says they're queer.""
Apakidze's book, 100 Years of Georgian Queer Art, is due to  come out later this year.
""There are a lot of things that can be reclaimed as queer,"" says Apakidze.
""Theatre and costume designer Petre Otskheli was killed in the 30s by the Soviet regime.
Elene Akhvlediani, a famous Georgian painter, was a lesbian woman wearing men's clothes, and no one says she's queer.
""Many of the most famous LGBTQ+ Georgian artists today find themselves living outside the country, though they sometimes take their experiences of homophobia with them.
Balenciaga's lead designer Demna Gvasalia, recently told New York Times Style ""growing up in a country where I couldn't say I was gay, I always tried to look like the kind of tough guy who would survive in the neighbourhoods where I lived.
I can't go back to Georgia because people have threatened to kill me if I return… my own uncle is one of them.
""Levan Akin's 2019 film, And Then We Danced depicted a gay romance among young dancers at the prestigious Georgian National Ensemble.
Like Giorgi Kikonishvili, he too was inspired by the homophobic riot in 2013.
By origin Georgian, Akin was a frequent visitor there growing up and speaks the language, but grew up in Sweden, where he still lives now.
His film scandalised conservatives in Georgia by combining the national dance with a gay coming-of-age drama, inspiring protests across the country.
While filming they had to lie about the film's content because the plot was so controversial.His new film Passage, which comes out later this year, tells the story of a Georgian woman who travels to Istanbul to find her niece, a trans woman.
""The genesis of the idea came when I heard a story while doing research for And Then We Danced about the relative of a trans woman who was the only one standing by her.
This made me think of telling a story from the perspective of a family member, showing their journey and growth.""
He notes that the success of And Then We Danced has made it harder to film surreptitiously this time.
Viewers of the 2019 film may be able to recognise Nata Talikishvili, who plays herself in a cameo role.
Akin told BBC Culture that Talikishvili is ""a natural actress"" as well as ""very witty, and candid"", and while researching the film he talked with her to learn more about queer life in Tblisi.Discussing the possibility in the future of joining the many trans people who have left Georgia for asylum in Europe, Talikishvili mentions how she loves Ireland's pub storytelling tradition.
When I mention that Ireland is quite a conservative country, she smiles – ""that's fine.
I am a conservative woman"".

culture,"Is calmness a passive state of being, involving numbing oneself to what's really going on?
Is it in some cases unnatural – sociopathic even?
Or is a sense of tranquillity one of the greatest qualities we can have?
Here are five ideas about calmness, from the philosophy of serenity, to the music, art and poetry that can make us feel peaceful – and how to find our ""flow"".More like this:-          Eight nature books to change your life-          The sci-fi genre offering hope-          Inside Japan's most minimalist homesStoic serenity""Stay calm and serene regardless of what life throws at you,"" advised the Roman philosopher Marcus Aurelius.
Sounds easier said than done, you would think.
But in fact, the Stoic Aurelius had a knack for making calmness seem easy to achieve.
The philosopher Epictetus and other Stoics believed that finding calm was essential – and within our control (Credit: Alamy)Aurelius's famous work Meditations is, according to John Sellars – author and Reader at Royal Holloway, University of London –  all about ""putting our everyday cares and concerns into wider perspective"".
As emperor of Rome, Aurelius faced huge pressures but, Sellars tells BBC Culture: ""He often reminds himself how brief his life is compared to the vastness of time, and how small it is compared to the whole of the cosmos.
""In line with his Stoic life view, Aurelius also reminds himself constantly that ""whatever frustration or negative emotions he might be feeling are ultimately the product of his own judgments or interpretations about situations, and so, as a consequence, things within his power to control,"" says Sellars.
But why the emphasis on being calm?
Is it really that important to find peace?
In the Stoic mindset, it seems, calmness is everything – it is strength.
As Aurelius writes in Meditations: ""The nearer a man comes to a calm mind, the closer he is to strength.
""Sellars explains: ""Calmness is essential to living a good, happy life, Marcus and his fellow Stoics would insist.
This is because a disturbed or troubled mind isn’t going to be able to make sensible, rational decisions.
The person in the grip of violent emotions, for instance, literally isn't thinking straight.
They have been overcome and may act impulsively or violently.
In order to make good decisions we need a calm frame of mind so that we can pause and reflect, rather than behaving merely reactively.""
According to the Stoics, we just need to see that calmness is within our control.
Whatever is going on in the world, ""it all depends on our judgments and interpretations of situations, not the situations themselves,"" explains Sellars.
The philosopher Epictetus, he adds, who was Aurelius's primary influence, wrote: ""When we are frustrated, angry or unhappy, never hold anyone except ourselves – that is, our judgements – accountable.
""This core Stoic idea was, says Sellars, ""a huge influence on the founders of modern cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and its effectiveness has been proven by the many studies of CBT that have been made"".
The electronic album Stellar Drifting by George FitzGerald is inspired by the cosmos – Setting Sun is a particularly tranquil listen (Credit: George FitzGerald)Electronic escapeFrom supposedly soothing pan pipes to ambient rainforest sounds, we are all accustomed to the stock idea of soundscapes as a calming backdrop.
But of course the sounds that each of us find restful are by definition a personal thing, and there is no one-size-fits-all soundtrack that will promote peacefulness for all.Just as the Stoics emphasised perspective and how small each of us is compared to the whole of the cosmos, electronic music artist George FitzGerald looked to the universe and the stars for inspiration for his 2022 album Stellar Drifting.
The musician told MusicTech: ""To me, [space] represented the furthest point away; the grandest vision of humanity.""
FitzGerald spent time in New Mexico driving in the desert and stargazing.
""Space gets you out of yourself.
It reminds you that we're tiny and insignificant.
""He took images of the universe collected by Nasa and, by feeding them into new software programmes, converted them into sounds, which he then developed into the 10 tracks on the album.
He also used audio recordings from probes that were floating around the solar system.Electronic, garage and house music have for decades been a form of escapism, first evolving in the interesting margins of society, and uniting disparate groups.
And according to FitzGerald, the stars in the sky are an escapism, one that connects all of us.
Probably the most calming track on the album is Setting Sun, to be enjoyed not necessarily on a busy dancefloor, but rather lying on a sofa or standing on a hillside, contemplating the vastness of the universe – and our own insignificance.Hilma af Klint's The Ten Largest, Group IV, No.
3 Youth 1907 will feature in an upcoming exhibition at the Tate Modern (Credit: Tate/ Courtesy of the Hilma af Klint Foundation)Art of tranquillityLikewise in visual art, one viewer's tranquil, meditative experience is another's intense psychodrama.
The New Yorker describes the work of Swedish artist Hilma af Kilmt as ""fearfully esoteric"" and resonating with a ""restlessly searching mood in present culture"".
For other spectators, masterpieces such as The Ten Largest, Group lV, No.
3 Youth 1907 are quintessentially peaceful in their enigmatic otherworldliness.
A Swedish mystic and painter, Af Klint developed her own lexicon of pastel-hued shapes several years ahead of other more feted abstract artists.
An exhibition this April at London's Tate Modern will explore her work alongside that of Piet Mondrian.
""At the heart of both of their artistic journeys was a shared desire to understand the forces behind life on Earth,"" says the Tate.Af Klint began her career as a landscape painter, inspired by nature, and then her work began to represent natural forms that veered towards abstraction.
Spirituality, theosophy and philosophy were central to her out-there vision, and her work reflects that sense of something bigger than us at play – in fact she actually believed her works were painted under the direction of higher spirits.
Like others before her, she viewed our existence as only a small element in the larger scheme of things.Undeniably woo-woo though her vision was, her interest in metaphysics and theosophy was intricate, even semi-scientific, and with its own internal logic – she was drawn to both the spiritualist writings of the founder of the Theosophical Society, Madam Blavatsky, and the philosophical ideas of the Medieval mystic Christian Rosenkreuz.
She wanted her work to facilitate spiritual mediation that would transcend physical reality, and to visualise a kind of astral world.Who knows the precise motivation or meaning behind these extraordinary, liminal, enigmatic artworks?
And perhaps that mystery and other-worldliness is what makes the act of looking at them, to some of us at least, such a profoundly peaceful experience.Harmony of haikuThe traditional form of Japanese poetry, haiku, which consists of 17 syllables in three lines, is widely considered to have a calming effect on the reader.
The structure of haiku follows a strict syllable count, and it encourages the poet to focus on a single image or moment, which in itself has a meditative effect.
The use of nature imagery in haiku also evokes feelings of serenity and peace.
The brevity and simplicity of haiku allows the reader to contemplate and consider the meaning and the imagery without feeling overwhelmed by excessive ideas and language.Matsuo Bashō of the Edo period, the best known haiku poet – his complete poetry is translated in the book On Love and Barley: Haiku of Basho – was born in Iga-ueno near Kyoto in 1644, and he began writing verse while acting as a companion to a local aristocrat.
Bashō was not only a master of haiku, but also a Buddhist monk and a great traveller – when he travelled he relied entirely on the hospitality of temples and fellow poets.
His gnomic poems combine the Zen idea of a oneness with creation with kurami, or lightness of touch.
Each of his poems evokes a scene from the natural world – a leaping frog, a summer moon, cherry blossom, winter snow – which suggest the smallness of human life in the context of the vastness of nature.
Pithy and spare, his most famous haiku is The Old Pond: ""Old pond/ A frog jumps in –/ The sound of water"".
Another is A Leafless Branch: ""On a leafless branch/ A crow comes to rest –/ Autumn nightfall"".Bashō led a solitary life completely free from possessions.
Arguably, his haiku are the result of a keen eye and a meditative mind that have been left clear from the distraction of ""stuff"", and so he is more alive to the beauty of the world around him – and closer to his own intuition.The wandering poet Matsuo Bashō was the master of haiku – he renounced all belongings and travelled far and wide, finding inspiration (Credit: Getty Images)As Daisetz T Suzuki writes in Zen in the Japanese Culture: ""A haiku does not express ideas but… puts forward images reflecting intuitions.
These images are not figurative representations made use of by the poetic mind, but they directly point to original intuitions, indeed they are intuitions themselves.""
The suggestion is that the composition of haiku is so intuitive, it is almost unconscious.Haiku and their close attention to the details of nature are part of the wider Japanese concepts of nagomi and ikigai, which roughly translated equate to a sense of meaning and harmony.
""[Haiku] gives us an insight into why the word ikigai exists in Japanese,"" writes Yukari Mitsuhashi in Ikigai: Giving Every Day Meaning and Joy.
""In our everyday lives, whether we are immersing ourselves in nature or devouring traditional Japanese food, paying attention to detail grabs our focus on to what is right in front of us, instead of wondering about our to-do lists in our head… permitting us to find joy and ikigai in simple, everyday things.
""And the principles of haiku can be calming when applied to other areas of life, too.
In his book Goodbye Things, Funio Sasaki writes: ""Traditional paintings have few figures in them and value negative space.
Japanese calligraphy and brush paintings are in black and white.
Haiku is the shortest poem form in the world.
These are a few examples of a minimalistic aesthetic in Japanese art and culture.""
In the book, Sasaki, like Bashō all those centuries before, decides to give away most of his possessions, and explores the feeling of calm and tranquillity that results: ""There are more things to gain from eliminating excess than you might imagine: time, space, freedom, and energy, for example.
""Find your flowCalmness is regarded by some with suspicion – is a state of calmness really just a state of passivity?
A surrender of engagement, giving up, or, worse, a sociopathic disconnection?But being calm need not equate with being passive or numb.
When we're absorbed in something we love – music, gardening, drawing, knitting, writing, whatever it is – we can enter an almost trance-like state of calm, mesmerised by what we are doing.
As Mitsuhashi argues in her book about ikigai, immersing ourselves in nature or a particular activity makes us focus on what is in front of us, freeing up our minds from other things, and enabling us to find peace.In her classic work The Artist's Way, Julia Cameron encourages the reader to ""make a commitment to quiet time"".
She writes: ""Creativity occurs in the moment, and in the moment we are timeless"".And author Mihaly Csiksezentmihalyi argues that what really makes us feel not only calm and peaceful, but also glad to be alive, is unlocking a more fulfilling state of being.
He calls this state of mind ""flow"".
In his book Flow: The Psychology of Happiness, he throws light on the idea that many philosophers before him have posited – that the way to peace doesn't lie in mindless detachment, but in mindful challenge.
Each of us finds our flow in different ways, and our sense of calm.If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.And if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.

culture,"On 15 January 1981, music legends Diana Ross and Gladys Knight, along with the ""godfather of rap"", Gil Scott-Heron, joined renowned musician Stevie Wonder on stage at the National Mall in Washington, DC.
The 50,000-strong audience chanted: ""Martin Luther King Day, we took a holiday,"" according to Scott-Heron’s 2012 memoir, The Last Holiday, as the stars began to sing Wonder's hit song, Happy Birthday, a tribute to the murdered civil rights leader.More like this:-       The US's first interracial love song-       America's first black superstars-       The love song that became an anthem""I just never understood/ How a man who died for good/ Could not have a day that would/ Be set aside for his recognition,"" they sang, electrifying the crowd.The 1980 song had represented the start of Wonder's campaign to make the birthday of renowned peace activist, Martin Luther King Jr, into a federal holiday.
For three years Wonder put his life on hold and dedicated tours, rallies and marches to bring his vision to life – a quest that would establish the first holiday in the US that honoured a black American.This year marks the 40th anniversary of US President Ronald Reagan signing into law the bill that established Martin Luther King Day.
Many today might be surprised to realise the instrumental role Stevie Wonder played in getting the legislation passed.
But in fact, the global superstar's artistry and political activism were intertwined throughout his career, even before the MLK Day drive, as he repeatedly called attention to social issues of mid-century America.Stevie Wonder and Coretta Scott King embrace after a campaign to make Martin Luther King Day a national holiday bears fruit (Credit: Getty Images)After Dr King's assassination in April 1968, US Representative John Conyers Jr from Detroit, Michigan, and Wonder's congressman, introduced a bill to make the activist's birthday a federal holiday.
But for 13 years, the bill languished, facing opposition from southern Democrats and conservative Republicans.
For years, Wonder had quietly advocated for the holiday.
But then, in 1979, he shared a dream he had with King's widow, Coretta Scott King.
In a 2011 interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, Wonder said: ""I said to her… 'I imagined in this dream I was doing this song.
We were marching with petition signs to make Dr King's birthday a national holiday.
'""Scott King was excited, Wonder explained, but she also doubted his dream could come true at a time the nation was turning more and more conservative with the rise of Reaganism and New Right politicians in the Sun Belt (the Southern US), a reaction against President Lyndon Baines Johnson's liberal agenda of the 1960s.
But Wonder felt compelled by his dream and the next year he wrote Happy Birthday, for Hotter than July, a 1980 album that peaked at number three in the US charts and number two in the UK.
Joined by Scott King, Wonder used his 1981 tour for that album as a worldwide drive to advocate for the holiday.
""Stevie Wonder could write almost any kind of song,"" music critic and documentary filmmaker Nelson George tells BBC Culture.
""And as part of his mix of songs and melodies, he was always able to create songs about social injustice, particularly happy, major chord melodies that were easy to sing to,"" he adds.
George compares Happy Birthday – a big, cheerful song – to another of Wonder's, Isn't She Lovely.
""For a whole group of people who grew up in the past 40 years, Happy Birthday has become the standard birthday song,"" he says.
""It's amazing that someone could just write something that becomes a standard part of life as well as have political significance, but he was able to do that.
""Soundtracking a movementWonder's quest to create a Martin Luther King Day holiday also followed the tradition of US musicians and popular artists who joined movements for social change throughout the 20th Century, according to Kevin Gaines, the Julian Bond professor of civil rights and social justice at the University of Virginia.
""He's right in line with Woody Guthrie in the 1930s and 40s, whose songs reflected the social issues of the time,"" Gaines tells BBC Culture.
""And African-American opera singer, Marian Anderson, who sang in front of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC to protest the Daughters of the American Revolution's refusal to let her sing in their meeting hall,"" he adds.
""And also Billie Holiday, who recorded the anti-lynching anthem, Strange Fruit, and was harassed in the South when she sang it live.
""Stevie Wonder's career closely tracked the mid-century civil rights movement, starting from his first number one hit, Fingertips, in 1963, Gaines says.
Wonder was just 13 years old when Fingertips hit the charts in the summer of 1963 – released in the wake of King's campaign to desegregate public accommodations in downtown Birmingham, Alabama.
Ostensibly a party song, Fingertips isn't overtly political like Wonder's later songs.
But the live recording is symbolic, with the 13-year-old's call and response to African-American teens to follow him in his celebration of black American rhythm and blues and soul beats.
""The Birmingham protests made world headlines,"" Gaines says, ""with photos and footage of police attacking children with dogs and high-pressure water hoses.""
Fingertips was a harbinger for how young people were going to be involved in the civil rights movement and youth protests of the 1960s.
""It becomes kind of a soundtrack to that movement,"" says Gaines.Stevie Wonder's career shadowed the civil rights movement, beginning with his first number one, 1963's Fingertips (Credit: Alamy)Although many of his early songs were not overtly political, throughout the 1960s, Wonder spoke directly in the African-American press about civil rights, Gaines says.
""It's unclear whether or not white Americans are hearing what he's saying about the movement as it's gaining momentum.
But he's on national TV along with other Motown artists crossing over into mainstream success,"" he says.
And at that time, for any black artist to be on national TV with crossover appeal was a significant achievement.While touring internationally during his teen years, Wonder connected with audiences overseas, getting a sense of himself as a global superstar and spokesperson.
By the late 1960s, he was inspired by other black artists, including Bill Withers, Curtis Mayfield and Gil Scott-Heron, who were making socially conscious music.
In 1969, Wonder saw fellow Motown star Marvin Gaye struggle to make his concept album, What's Going On, for a label reluctant to be seen as overtly political.
After hearing the song, What's Going On, in 1970, Motown owner Berry Gordy was absolutely opposed to releasing it, thinking that a social commentary concept song and album would be a disaster for Motown's crossover reputation.
A seven-month power struggle began between Gaye and Gordy over making the record, which finally ended with the release of what became one of the most important protest albums in pop music history.
Realising he wanted to express his own opinions, Wonder renegotiated his contract with Motown and by 1971, at the age of 21, Wonder retained full control of his music and publishing, a rare opportunity in the pop music world.
He embraced the creative freedom and artistic independence he got from the new contract – fulfilling his ambitions of making music a forum for black political concerns and from a black perspective.In 1972, he released the seminal album, Talking Book, with politically charged songs including Big Brother, which contained some of the frankest, most socially conscious lyrics he had written up to that point.
""Big Brother is a very strong protest song,"" Gaines tells BBC Culture.
""He says 'You've killed all our leaders… You've caused your own country to fail.'""
Wonder was describing a US society that responded to the social movements of the 1960s with violence and a series of political assassinations.
""He's clearly questioning the legitimacy of the political order at that time,"" says Gaines.The early 1970s was a disastrous era for African-American activists, with state crackdowns on the Black Panthers and the killing of Black Power leaders in Chicago, and Big Brother reflected those real events.
On Wonder's next album, Innervisions, songs including Higher Ground, Too High, and of course, one of his most influential songs, Living for the City, gave a stark view of the urban landscape.
A cinematic story of the 20th-Century black American migration from the rural South to urban North, the song features a spoken word interlude that takes us right on to New York City streets with the roar of a bus and police sirens.
It describes how a young black man from Mississippi gets caught up in crime, drugs and the police brutality many urban African Americans faced at the time – and remains relevant into the 21st Century.A new national holidayBy 1980, with the release of Happy Birthday's call to action, Wonder was one of the most important musicians in the country, and Dr King's birthday became a rallying point to codify his activism, says Nelson George.
""People were looking at that point to honour King and his movement and the change in America.
""But the America that King was murdered in, in 1968, was different from that of 1980, with civil rights struggles morphing into new challenges like equal opportunity in housing and education.
The newly-elected Regan administration was cool on civil rights issues, and Reagan initially spoke out against the idea of a national holiday, resurrecting the old innuendo about King being a subversive communist, just as civil rights opponents in the 1950s had.
""There were people then and probably still now, who just didn't want a black person to have a national holiday,"" George says.
Many in the US also balked at the idea of making a holiday for someone who wasn't a president or a government official, let alone a social activist.
""There were a lot of threads working against this happening,"" he adds.Wonder's 1980 song Happy Birthday was a call to action to honour the legendary civil rights leader Martin Luther King (Credit: Getty Images)After Wonder's Hotter than July tour in 1981, he and Scott King began heavy lobbying of politicians and in 1982 delivered a petition to Congress with six million signatures.
By January 1983, Wonder decided not to repeat his annual rally at the National Mall.
Instead, he switched tactics and spent the day at a special legislative hearing to urge Congress to pass legislation.
Finally, on 2 November 1983, their activism bore fruit, and President Reagan signed a bill into law to create a federal holiday honouring Martin Luther King Jr's birthday.
""It was wonderful to see the biggest artist of his time, through his peak years of popularity, harness his talent and his celebrity to do something that actually made a difference,"" George says, adding that with the passage of the new law, we should see the song Happy Birthday as a ""successful piece of political agitation"".
""I think that artists have been the catalyst for expressing social conditions since the beginning of all time,” Stevie Wonder said in 1980, when he first announced his drive for a national MLK Day.
""I am not political.
I am not a leader.
I am a human being given the honour and gift of song.
And with it, I give the best possible.

culture,"If asked to guess what under 25-year-olds are listening to, it's unlikely that many of us would land upon orchestral music.
And yet a survey published in December 2022 by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO) found that 74% of UK residents aged under 25 were likely to be tuning into just that at Christmas-time, compared with a mere 46% of people aged 55 or more.
These figures reflect not only the RPO's broader finding that under 35-year-olds are more likely to listen to orchestral music than their parents, but also the widespread surge in popularity of classical music in general, particularly among younger generations.More like this:-          The radical trend millennials love-          The forgotten Soviet genius of music-          Have film and TV got Gen Z all wrong?There are plenty of reasons for this, from the playlist culture spawned by streaming platforms that make it easy for listeners to discover new artists and types of music to fit their mood, to the solace it provided during the pandemic, not to mention the profusion of classical music in pop culture hits like Squid Game.
But perhaps highest on the list is the global wave of Gen Z and young millennial classical artists who are finding new ways to be seen and heard, and – just as vitally – new means of modernising what has long been branded music's most elite and stuffy genre.Fashion brand Acne Studios' younger sub-label Face recently created composer-themed sweaters and bags (Credit: Acne Studios/ Face)Unsurprisingly, social media has played a huge part in this, as a quick search of the popular TikTok hashtag ""classictok"" (currently at 53.8 million views) attests.
There, as well as on Instagram, young classical artists have been making use of the digital realm's democratic potential to lift the heavy velvet curtains on their art form, presenting classical music and its storied history in ways that are accessible, unintimidating and, most importantly, fun.For French violinist Esther Abrami – who has more than 250,000 followers on Instagram, more than 380,000 on TikTok, and was the first classical musician to be nominated in the Social Media Superstar category at the Global Awards – the journey to social media fame stemmed from a desire to share her passion more widely.
""I was studying at a top institution and most of the time I was practising for exams, so the whole joy of sharing was taken away.
Then, at the very few concerts I did play, there was a very specific type of audience that wasn't very diverse,"" Abrami tells BBC Culture.She noticed that a handful of classical musicians had taken to Instagram to broaden their own reach, and decided to do the same.
""I started posting a few things, and was stunned by the reaction that I got.
Suddenly you have people from around the world listening to you and telling you it brightens their day to watch you playing the violin,"" she enthuses.
""It opened this door to a completely new world.
""Nigerian-US baritone and lifelong hip-hop fan Babatunde Akinboboye enjoyed a similarly swift and surprising rise to social media fame when he posted a video of himself singing Rossini's renowned aria Largo al factotum over the top of Kendrick Lamar's track Humble.
""I was in my car and I realised that the two pieces worked together musically, so I started singing on top of the beat,"" he tells BBC Culture.
He documented the moment on his phone and posted the video on his personal Facebook account, guessing that his friends would enjoy it more than his opera peers.
""But I went to sleep, woke up the next morning, and it had expanded to my opera network, and far beyond that,"" he laughs, explaining that within two days, his self-dubbed brand of ""hip-hopera"" had caught the attention of The Ellen Show, America's Got Talent and Time magazine.Nigerian-US baritone Babatunde Akinboboye sings ""hip-hopera"" – he initially became known for his rendition of Rossini blended with Kendrick Lamar (Credit: J Demetrie)Both Abrami and Akinboboye came to classical music in their teens, late by conventional standards, and cultivated their passion for the genre independently.
This remains a driving factor in their desire to reach new audiences, which they've achieved on an impressive scale, largely just by being themselves.
""I ended up becoming an opera influencer by sharing the parts of me I felt comfortable sharing, which is a lot,"" says Akinboboye, whose playful hip-hopera and opera videos and posts – taking viewers behind the scenes of a world still shrouded in mystery  – have garnered him some 688,000 TikTok followers.
""It's a lot about how I relate to opera; my musical background was from hip-hop, but I still found a relationship with opera and that resonated with people,"" he explains.
""Almost every day I get a different message saying, 'I went to my first opera today'.
I think it's because they're seeing someone they feel comfortable or familiar with.
""'Complex and profound'Abrami, a similarly enthusiastic content creator, agrees: ""I think putting the face of somebody not so far away from them to the genre is a big thing.
That's what I'm trying to do, to reach different types of people and create bridges, to show them that this music can really move you.
It's complex and profound and yes, it might take a bit of time to understand but once you do, it's amazing.
""British concert pianist Harriet Stubbs is another avid proponent of classical music for modern audiences who has been finding her own ways of drawing in new listeners.
During lockdown, the musician, who usually splits her time between London and New York, performed multiple 20-minute concerts from her ground-floor flat in West Kensington, opening the windows and using an amplifier to reach listeners outside.
""I gave 250 concerts,"" Stubbs, who was awarded a British Empire Medal by the Queen for this mood-boosting act of service, tells BBC Culture.
""I did a range of repertoire from my upcoming album, and also things like All By Myself, which I chose ironically for that audience.
And the thing is, people who thought they didn't care for classical music came back every day because of the power of that music.
""The fusion of classical music with other genres is a major facet of Stubbs's practice and, indeed, that of many others among the new generation of classical artists (see also the React to the K YouTube channel, where classical artists frequently reimagine K-pop songs with ingenious results, or Kris Bowers' brilliant orchestral arrangements of modern pop songs for the much-buzzed-about Bridgerton soundtrack).
Stubbs's innovative first album, Heaven & Hell: The Doors of Perception (2018), was inspired by William Blake and features musical icon Marianne Faithfull.
""I always wanted to tie rock'n'roll and classical music together and put them in the same space, supported by literature and philosophy and other disciplines,"" she explains, adding that her next album, which she's making with pianist and former Bowie collaborator Mike Garson, will be a ""Bowie meets Rachmaninoff"" affair.Concert pianist Harriet Stubbs has collaborated with Marianne Faithfull, and is currently working on a ""Bowie meets Rachmaninoff"" album (Credit: Russ Titelman)Interestingly, the current swell of enthusiasm for classical music has branched out to become as much of an aesthetic movement as it is a musical one.
Digital microtrends Dark Academia and Light Academia – dedicated as they are to the romanticisation of a passion for art and knowledge through imagery – both make rousing use of classical music in order to create the desired ambience.
Ascendant Polish countertenor Jakub Józef Orliński, meanwhile, uses atmospheric visuals as a powerful means of contemporising the baroque experience.
Depressed by the lack of funding for music video production in the classical realm, he drummed up private sponsorship to make a 21-minute movie to accompany his 2021 rendition of Vivaldi's Stabat Mater.
The resulting film conjures a compelling and suitably brutal scenario for the haunting 18th-century hymn, which The New York Times describes as ""resembling a Polish remake of The Sopranos"".
""I'm really interested in storytelling.
I always build an entire concept for my albums – the narrative, the photography, the videos,"" Orliński tells BBC Culture.
""I think now there is this whole new generation of people who really want to add to what classical music can be, to go beyond the singing and be challenged.
You just have to know that the end product will be good, and that what you're doing will serve the story,"" he adds.
This is certainly something Orliński has achieved in his own career: an accomplished sportsman and breakdancer, he wowed critics with his 2022 Royal Opera House debut, which found him pole-dancing in a spangled dress as Didymus in Katie Mitchell's production of Handel's Theodora.
Other recent projects have included recording baroque tracks for forthcoming video games which, he says, was ""an incredible experience"" and is something he's being asked to do more and more frequently, as the Metaverse beckons.
""Sometimes you need classical music to touch the strings of somebody's soul – a pop song won't work.
""Classical music's ongoing and often powerful intersection with pop culture is being foregrounded as part of the burgeoning interest in the genre, both inside and outside its famously guarded gates.
The all-teen members of the UK's National Youth Orchestra have just completed a mini tour that included a performance of Richard Strauss's Also Sprach Zarathustra, replete with its opening symphonic sunrise eternalised by Stanley Kubrick in 2001: A Space Odyssey.
Last August saw the BBC Proms launch its first gaming-themed programme whereby the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra took on some of the best-loved songs in video game history.
While the recent autumn/winter collection from Acne Studios' younger sub-label Face offered up one of the most direct sartorial tributes to classical music to date, presenting crew-neck sweaters, T-shirts and tote bags embellished with the faces of Handel, Mozart and Bach in celebration of ""the idea that a passion for classical music is the most left-field move imaginable for a modern-day teenager"".Polish countertenor Jakub Józef Orliński wowed critics with his performance as Didymus in Handel's Theodora, which included a pole-dance (Credit: Michael Sharkey)Orliński agrees that classical music has achieved an ""almost hipstery"" status of late.
""It's cool to go to the opera, to know something, and that's because there are a lot of young artists delivering music on the highest level, while making it very entertaining,"" he enthuses.
There is, he observes, a revived interest in classical music personalities such as Maria Callas and Pavarotti, as well as ""people like Yuja Wang"" who are selling out concert halls, all of which he feels bodes well for the art form.
""We have a long way to go to grow as much as other genres of music, but we're moving forward.""
Akinboboye, too, is tentatively hopeful.
""I think opera is definitely being a lot more bold, and I hope that it continues because I think we can catch up,"" he concludes.
""[Classical music needs to] be brave, to do the scary thing.
And it'll work out, because audiences are ready.

culture,"Eeriness has long been a sensation that we have understood as intangible: an eerie location or situation is one where a person can feel frightened or unsettled for reasons beyond their comprehension.
In that way, there is some overlap between ""the eerie"" and Sigmund Freud's feelings of Das Unheimliche or ""the uncanny"", where unspecified familiarity with an event renders it unnerving.More like this: – The strange allure of ancient stone circles  – The magical master of British literature – The classic thriller that demonised rural folkBut while eeriness is, by its very nature, elusive, ""the eerie"" is something that over the last decade or so particularly, critics and academics have tried to define more thoroughly, particularly in relation to art.
Now it is understood as the foundation of a body of work that commonly deals in haunted landscapes and unexplained dread.Enys Men centres on a lone volunteer on a Cornish island recording its plant life – but unravelling in her isolation (Credit: Steve Tanner)In a 2015 essay for the Guardian, author Robert Macfarlane identified a particular trend in English art that he classified as the ""English eerie"".
The eerie as defined by Macfarlane is an intersection between rural landscapes and ""that form of fear that is felt first as unease, then as dread, and which is incited by glimpses and tremors rather than outright attack"".
He concludes that ""horror specialises in confrontation and aggression; the eerie in intimation and aggregation"".
The ""English eerie"" can be detected in a variety of work: in the fiction of MR James, Alan Garner and Benjamin Myers, on television in shows like the BBC's Ghost Stories at Christmas and cult children's fantasy series Children of the Stones (1977), and in art by the likes of Derek Jarman, Tacita Dean and Paul Nash.The work of filmmaker Mark Jenkin also fits under this umbrella.
For over two decades, the director has created uniquely haunting films, notable among other things for the fact that they are shot on celluloid, its home-developed imperfections sitting in stark contrast to the digitisation of film culture since the turn of the millennium.
Breaking through to bigger audiences in 2020 with the Bafta-winning Bait, the director returns this year with the equally disquieting Enys Men.Jenkin has a second preoccupation alongside his analogue sensibility: the landscape and culture of his native Cornwall.
While Bait was a deeply modern tale of Cornish gentrification told with old technology, Enys Men reflects that same local interest but with stronger cohesion between the old filmic form and its period setting.Enys Men – Cornish for ""stone island"" and no doubt a reference to the film's many visuals of standing stones – is set on a mysterious isle off the Cornish coast in the 1970s.
It concerns a volunteer (Mary Woodvine) as she goes about her life in an isolated cottage.
She spends her days keeping track of some of the island's plant life and tending the generator that supplies her cottage with power, and she has brief moments of human contact via radio and a visiting local sailor (Edward Rowe).
Soon, ghostly visions haunt her, featuring the island's mining past as well as shards of her own life.
Has the solitude driven her into a state of nightmarish delusion or is something beyond her understanding rising from the land?BBC Culture spoke to Jenkin about his new film and the preoccupations of his work.
""I was a rural kid,"" he suggests when asked of his influences, ""and I suppose I always seemed to be attracted to the dark side of things, a desire to be a bit scared, but to also look at the flip side of the idyll.
Part of that is a reaction against the way that Cornwall is idealised and romanticised.
""Jenkin's film is a perfect, anti-romantic expression of Cornish eeriness.
""There is certainly a level of abstraction that comes from shooting small-gauge film,"" he says of his trusty Bolex 16mm camera, ""but most of the eerie comes later in the process, [in] how the images bump up against each other and most importantly how the sound works with, and against, the image.”The subversive mission of 'eerie' artAs identified by Macfarlane and others, the eerie acts as a kind of counter-tradition to the romantic Pastoralism of English art; rather than portraying the English countryside as a place of chocolate-box fantasy, it has often zoned in on specific rural localities and tried to convey their haunted essences that are beyond the understanding of urbanite considerations.In doing so, ""eerie"" art can be political: according to Macfarlane, there is often a ""dissenting left politics at work"".
Eerie work resists the picture-postcard vision of rural England and marks it as a site of violence and trauma, historically and contemporaneously.
The countryside of the eerie is the location of previous class struggles such as the fights against the Enclosures Act – the 1773 act that effectively made huge swathes of common land private – and Gerrard Winstanley's rebellion of Diggers who continued to work on land that was privatised by the act.
Indeed, Kevin Brownlow and Andrew Mollo’s film about this episode, Winstanley (1975), is an especially fitting example of such politically charged eerie work.
Equally, the battles over green spaces continue to influence eerie work to this day, with protests and campaigns arguing for people's ""right to roam"" over the land and the continued assault upon the environment by a myriad of industries.Requiem for a Village (1976) was part of a wave of 1970s British films that mixed a documentary-style depiction of the countryside with eerie elements (Credit: BFI)Within eerie work, slow dread is also preferred over direct confrontation, which is precisely the atmosphere of Enys Men.
The first half of Jenkin's film is methodical and patient, building on the main character's ritualistic engagement with the landscape.
""I can't help but capture the landscape around me,"" says Jenkin.
""The film relies on an authentic portrayal of this specific place, and as it is set on an apparently deserted island, in many ways there isn't much else to capture.""
Again and again, Jenkin films the volunteer studying plants on the rocky coastline before her routine of finding a stone to drop into the darkness of an old mine shaft.
The character's engagement with the landscape triggers memories from her past and the island's.Dr Katy Soar from the University of Winchester has researched the eerie with particular regard to its relationship to landscape and history, and with reference to the work of eerie author Arthur Machen.
""Landscape is an actor in the eerie,"" she tells BBC Culture, ""not just a stage; it plays a part in the narrative rather than simply providing a backdrop for it"".
Soar's ideas sit comfortably with Jenkin's film, especially in its depiction of a temporally unstable landscape where different periods of time merge and meet.
""A landscape is never finished, or fixed,"" Soar says.
""This lack of stability can cause profound unease, and as such these capricious landscapes provide a threat which is often the catalyst for eerie events.
""It is only later in Enys Men that more horrifying visions enter, and, even then, they seem abstract compared to the definite visitations of more typical horror.
Sometimes these visions and atmospheres arise for only a second before vanishing, and with little indication that they were there at all.
Women in traditional clothing move in unison on the cliff tops, lichen grows from an old scar on the volunteer's body, and the faces of miners peer out of the darkness of old shafts.These visions are eerie not simply because they are derived from the rural landscape but because they only intimate their presence; they are glimpsed terrors.
The eerie resists revealing its horrors head on.
""The mood of the eerie is lingering,"" Soar believes, ""a sensation that is hard to shake off.
The eerie doesn't deal in jump scares, but involves a nagging, troubling sense of doubt and uncertainty that colours all activities.
""In his essay The Weird and the Eerie (2016), the academic Mark Fisher defined eeriness as ""constituted by a failure of absence or by a failure of presence"".
That is, for Fisher, the eerie ""occurs either when there is something present where there should be nothing, or if there is nothing present when there should be something"".
Enys Men falls into the former camp, where the island should be absence made manifest, but instead provides spectres of class trauma breaking the volunteer's solitude.
The local industry and its demise is the most unsettled ghost of the film.The lineage of ""eerie"" cinemaEmphasising that Enys Men is far from the first film to explore the English (and more specifically the Cornish) landscape in such an eerie manner, a season of films curated by Jenkin will be screened at the British Film Institute in London.
What many of his choices show is continuity between Enys Men and previous eerie work, belying the simplistic description of ""folk horror"" – a more obviously aggressive genre in which landscape, folklore and superstition are weaponised to produce violence and supernatural happenings – that Jenkin's film has been assigned in many reviews.Enys Men feels closer to a branch of cinema that is subtler and more concerned with unnamed, half-intuited dread than the direct confrontations of folk horror.
It may be easy to liken the film to Robin Hardy's The Wicker Man (1973) and Piers Haggard's The Blood on Satan's Claw (1971) – two of British Folk Horror's most recognisable films – but the cinema it really feels indebted to is much quieter.Sculptor Barbara Hepworth is perhaps the most famous artist to capture the eeriness of the Cornish landscape in her work (Credit: Alamy)The 1970s saw a wealth of films deal with the decidedly strange atmospheres of English landscapes in a similar fashion – films such as David Gladwell's Requiem for a Village (1976), Peter Hall's Akenfield (1974), both set in Suffolk, and Philip Trevelyan's Sussex-centred documentary The Moon and the Sledgehammer (1971).
All of these mix documentary aesthetics and a desire to capture life in the countryside with stranger elements, whether it be people rising from their graves, as in Gladwell's film, or overlapping time periods, as in Hall's.Several more recent eerie films feel in tune with Jenkin's too.
Ben Rivers' meditative Two Years at Sea (2012) shares some crossover thanks to its home-developed 16mm visuals and emptied landscapes (Rivers and Jenkin are sharing a stage at the BFI later this month to discuss their work), as do several experimental landscape films of recent years such as Gideon Koppel's Sleep Furiously (2008), Andrew Kötting's By Our Selves (2015) and Paul Wright's Arcadia (2017).Especially important to Jenkin is the Children's Film Foundation short Haunters of the Deep (1984) by Andrew Bogle.
The CFF was a non-profit UK organisation that produced children's films for Saturday morning matinee screenings from the late 1940s to the 1980s.
A spooky tale about a haunted mine that was set on the Cornish coastline, Haunters of the Deep feels especially poignant as an influence as, Jenkin enthuses, it ""shares a location with Enys Men and also some subject matter.
I remember seeing the film when I was young and being freaked out by some of the images.
They have really stayed with me and I’ve paid homage to one of them.
""Looking beyond these screen influences, continuity can also be drawn between Jenkin's film and eerie work in other media that is similarly focused on Cornwall.
With its array of menhir (human-produced, upright standing stones) dotting the landscape and rich folklore, the location has inspired many artists.
Eileen Agar used Cornish landscapes (as well as physical debris from the coastline) to make an incredible array of eerie and esoteric work across many forms, while sculptor Barbara Hepworth played off the standing stones and shapes within the Cornish landscape to create a celebrated catalogue of eerie sculptures.
Even novels such as Over Sea, Under Stone (1965) by Susan Cooper recognise the eerie potential of the location.
""And then,"" wrote Cooper, ""looming over the dark brow of the headland, they saw the outline of the standing stones… As they drew nearer, the stones seemed to grow, pointing silently to the sky, like vast tombstones set on end.""
She could easily be describing visuals seen in Enys Men.
""My filmmaking is an ongoing attempt to make sense of the world and specifically the little bit of it where I happen to live,"" Jenkin concludes.
""I have a continuing obsession with making significant the seemingly insignificant simply by filming it.""
Yet, Fisher’s own conclusions suggest that to make sense of the world through the eerie is ultimately an impossibility as it ""concerns the unknown; when knowledge is achieved, the eerie disappears"".For Fisher, the eerie is perceivable but unknowable.
In Jenkin's attempt to understand his personal locality, Enys Men may successfully and beautifully transmute the unspeakable eeriness of Cornwall into spectral crackles of celluloid, but we may never truly know or face its lurking horrors head on.Enys Men is released in the UK on 13 January.

culture,"Live-action video game adaptations are hardly renowned for being serious works of art.
At best, the last decade has produced well-crafted family fare, such as Sonic the Hedgehog and Detective Pikachu; at worst, the genre has found itself defined by a string of cynical mediocrities and unwatchable failures.
The challenge tends to be two-fold.
Video games themselves – while capable of telling compelling stories on their own terms – do not translate naturally to movies and TV shows; while the people in charge of financing or making those movies and TV shows have been known to have little respect for what makes them worth adapting in the first place.
Neither of which is the case for HBO's remarkable nine-part adaptation of The Last of Us, generally regarded as one of the greatest video game stories ever told.
More like this: – 11 TV shows to watch this January– How the apocalypse is being reimagined– The most controversial show of 2022Originally released in 2013, The Last of Us is set amidst the ravages of a post-apocalyptic US, 20 years after a parasitic fungus called Cordyceps has turned most of the population into mindless monsters.
It follows a hardened smuggler named Joel, played in the show by Pedro Pascal, who has been tasked with escorting across the country Ellie (Bella Ramsey), a teenage girl with an apparent rare immunity to the infection.
In an interview with The New Yorker, creator Neil Druckmann recalled how, in 2014, a film adaptation fell through because executives wanted to make it bigger and ""sexier"", like the Brad Pitt film World War Z.
The game, however, offers a more intimate story.
It is a character study of astonishing depth, offering around 15 hours of gameplay.
It burns dark, violent, slow; thick with an atmosphere of melancholy and dread; heavily influenced by the aesthetics of prestige television and cinema.
Druckmann himself has referenced the Coen Brothers film No Country for Old Men as a touchstone.
It is an essence that has been captured deftly in this small-screen iteration by both Druckmann and co-showrunner Craig Mazin, the writer behind the similarly dark and atmospheric 2019 HBO drama Chernobyl.
It is a faithful adaptation in everything from look to score to feel, with the early episodes in particular following the game almost beat-for-beat.
We meet loving father Joel on the day of the outbreak, as he desperately tries to keep his daughter Sarah (Nico Parker) safe from a chaotic, crumbling Texas.
The infected are fast and rabid at first, but cut to 20 years later and the Cordyceps has spread from the brain to all over the body, creating an array of monstrosities.
The most terrifying of which are Clickers, whose fungi-covered eyes mean that they possess super-sensitive hearing.
The way they screech, the way they jerk, the way they force you to stay absolutely still, is a horror to behold.It is around this time that we're reintroduced to an older, more grizzled Joel, changed by the things he has had to do to survive.
He works as a smuggler (food, ammunition, drugs) in a Quarantine Zone in Boston, where life is tough, resources are scarce and the remnants of the government – now run by FEDRA (Federal Disaster Response Agency), heavily based on real US government agency FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) – rule with an iron fist.
Pascal is not as rugged as video game Joel, but his performance is raw and haunted.
He is a man hollowed out by grief, who has buried his humanity and cheer beneath mounds of cynicism and violence.
But Pascal is also a sensitive, soulful actor, and seeing Joel soften and thaw throughout the series is one of its great pleasures.The reason for this change is Ellie, who Joel must deliver to a group called the Fireflies – a revolutionary militia fighting to bring down FEDRA and restore democracy – in the hope that they can use her immunity to develop a vaccine.
The show essentially lives or dies on the casting of Ellie, who is as playful and profane as she is endearingly obnoxious.
Thankfully Bella Ramsey, best known for her brief turn as Lyanna Mormont in Game of Thrones, steals every scene she is in.
Her Ellie is a loveable little terror, full of charisma and bravado, serving as the perfect foil to Pascal's stoicism.
There's a real wit and warmth to the writing too, as Ellie gradually breaks down Joel’s defences with her favourite book of bad puns.
""Can I ask you a serious question?""
she whispers in the dark, as both of them try to sleep in the woods, ""why did the scarecrow get an award?
""The humour is much needed in the bleak, violent world that they traverse, where people are just as dangerous as the infected.
The video game, which is split into four seasons across a year, is episodic in nature, with most locations featuring a sub-plot sketched out in letters and mementos that the player finds.
The show builds upon these letters and fleshes them out into fully-formed stories.
And it is here, when Druckmann and Mazin are at their most audacious in terms of creative licence, that The Last of Us truly sings as television.Episode three, for example, turns a series of bitter letters between two men called Bill and Frank (implied to be lovers) into the most tender of romances.
Set across two decades, it follows paranoid prepper Bill (Nick Offerman) as he strikes up a relationship with Frank (The White Lotus' Murray Bartlett), a man who stumbles into one of his many traps.
What follows is a beautiful, exquisitely performed exploration of The Last of Us' central theme: that the ashes of the world are enough, as long as there is someone to live for amongst them.It is a sentiment that is turned inside-out in episodes four and five, which follow Joel and Ellie as they make their way through the aftermath of a bloody uprising against an especially fascistic branch of FEDRA in Kansas City.
The superb Melanie Lynskey (Yellowjackets) features here as the chillingly violent and vengeful leader of the revolution.
She wants all collaborators executed, with a special emphasis on a man called Henry (Lamar Johnson), who murdered her brother.
These episodes also feature some of the show's best action sequences, including a huge set-piece involving the infected that is as grisly and gripping as any in the game.It is not a perfect adaptation.
There are certain scenes early on that feel too gamey for television (such as those where Joel and Ellie are sneaking around a museum), while the latter half of the series feels like it needs one more episode to even out the pace (scenes involving the infected are strangely scarce beyond episode five).
There is also the fact that no on-screen adaptation of The Last of Us will ever truly capture what makes the source material so interesting: to be immersed in that world, to luxuriate in spaces that feel haunted by absence, to be eaten alive by a Clicker.And yet, it doesn't feel even remotely controversial to call this the best video game adaptation ever made.
For fans of the game, it is an adaptation of the utmost skill and reverence, yet one still capable of surprise; for people who have never picked up a controller, it is an encapsulation of the game's heart and soul – its full-blooded characters, its neat plotting, its mature themes of love and loss.
It is, to finish Ellie's joke, ""outstanding in its field"".★★★★☆The Last of Us premieres on 15 January on HBO in the US and 16 January on Sky Atlantic and NOW in the UKLove film and TV?

future,"At first glance, saliva seems like pretty boring stuff, merely a convenient way to moisten our food.
But the reality is quite different, as scientists are beginning to understand.
The fluid interacts with everything that enters the mouth, and even though it is 99% water, it has a profound influence on the flavours – and our enjoyment – of what we eat and drink.
""It is a liquid, but it's not just a liquid,"" says oral biologist Guy Carpenter of King's College London.Scientists have long understood some of saliva's functions: it protects the teeth, makes speech easier and establishes a welcoming environment for foods to enter the mouth.
But researchers are now finding that saliva is also a mediator and a translator, influencing how food moves through the mouth and how it sparks our senses.
Emerging evidence suggests that interactions between saliva and food may even help to shape which foods we like to eat.The substance is not very salty, which allows people to taste the saltiness of a potato chip.
It's not very acidic, which is why a spritz of lemon can be so stimulating.
The fluid's water and salivary proteins lubricate each mouthful of food, and its enzymes such as amylase and lipase kickstart the process of digestion.This wetting also dissolves the chemical components of taste, or tastants, into saliva so they can travel to and interact with the taste buds.
Through saliva, says Jianshe Chen, a food scientist at Zhejiang Gongshang University in Hangzhou, China, ""we detect chemical information of food: the flavour, the taste.
""You might also like:Chen coined the term ""food oral processing"" in 2009 to describe the multidisciplinary field that draws on food science, the physics of food materials, the body's physiological and psychological responses to food, and more, a subject he wrote about in the 2022 Annual Review of Food Science and Technology.
When people eat, he explains, they don't actually savour the food itself, but a mixture of the food plus saliva.
For example, an eater can perceive a sweet or sour-tasting molecule in a bite of food only if that molecule can reach the taste buds – and for that to happen, it must pass through the layer of saliva that coats the tongue.That's not a given, says Carpenter, who points to how flat soda tastes sweeter than fizzy soda.
Researchers had assumed this was because bursting bubbles of carbon dioxide in fresh soda provided an acidic hit that essentially distracted the brain from the sweetness.
But when Carpenter and his colleagues studied the process in the lab in a sort of artificial mouth, they found that saliva prevented the soda's bubbles from flowing between tongue and palate.
Carpenter thinks these backed-up bubbles could physically block the sugars from reaching the taste receptors on the tongue.
With flat soda, no bubbles build up to block the sweet taste.Food scientist Jianshe Chen says saliva helps transfer chemical information from food - like the refreshing zing of lemons - to tastebuds (Credit: Flavia Morlachetti/Getty Images)Saliva can also affect the aromas – which are responsible for the vast majority of our perception of flavour – that arise from food in the mouth.
As we chew, some flavour molecules in the food dissolve in the saliva, but those that don't can waft up into the nasal cavity to be sensed by the myriad receptors there.
As a result, people with different salivary flow rates, or different saliva composition – especially of proteins called mucins – may have very different flavour experiences from the same food or beverage.For example, Spanish researchers measured the flow of saliva in 10 volunteers who evaluated wine to which fruity-flavoured esters had been added.
Volunteers who produced more saliva tended to score the flavours as more intense, possibly because they swallowed more often and thus forced more aromas into their nasal passages, the scientists found.
So wine enthusiasts proud of their ability to detect nuances of aroma may have their spit to thank, at least in part.Saliva also plays a star role in our perception of texture.
Take astringency, that dry feeling that happens in the mouth when you drink red wine or eat unripe fruit.
The wine doesn't actually make your mouth drier.
Instead, molecules called tannins in the wine can cause proteins to precipitate out of the saliva so that it no longer lubricates as effectively.Saliva also helps us to perceive the difference between high-fat and low-fat foods.
Even if two yoghurts look the same and pour the same, a low-fat version feels drier in the mouth, says Anwesha Sarkar, a food scientist at the UK's University of Leeds.
""What you're trying to understand is not the property of the food, but how the food is interacting with the surface [of the mouth],"" Sarkar says.
Milk fat can combine with saliva to create a layer of droplets that can mask astringency and add a feeling of richness to the yoghurt, she says.Sarkar's research uses a mechanical tongue, bathed in artificial saliva, as a way to simulate what happens as food moves through the mouth and how that influences the sensory experience of eating.
A smoothie with lower fat, Sarkar says, might look creamy at first glance but will lack the textural luxuriousness that fat provides upon mixing with saliva.Wine aficionados proud of their abilities to detect flavour might have their saliva to thank – at least partly (Credit: Westend61/Getty Images)Fully understanding these interactions between saliva, food and the mouth – and how the information transfers to the brain – could lead to the design of healthier foods, says Sarkar.
She envisions developing a ""gradient food"" that might include enough sugar on the outside of the food to dissolve in saliva to give a sense of sweetness but it would be at a lower concentration and calorie level in the whole food.
She says a similar conceptual approach could help reduce fat in foods.But understanding these interactions well enough to develop such foods won't be easy, because saliva and perception vary throughout the day and between individuals.
Generally, saliva flows slowly in the morning and fastest in the early afternoon.
And the components of any individual's saliva – the amounts of certain proteins, for example – will vary throughout the day, and in the presence or absence of stimuli such as tantalising aromas.Oral biochemist Elsa Lamy of the University of Évora in Portugal investigated this by blindfolding volunteers, letting them smell a piece of bread for about four minutes, while monitoring their saliva for changes.
Two types of protein, starch-digesting amylases and others called cystatins that have been linked to taste sensitivity and perception, increased after exposure to the bread, she found.
Lamy's group has done similar experiments with vanilla and lemons, and in all cases found changes in the levels of saliva proteins, though the specific changes depended on the food presented.
Her team is now working to understand what function this may serve.The makeup of saliva varies from person to person – and that depends partly on an individual's past food choices, says Ann-Marie Torregrossa, a behavioural neuroscientist at the University at Buffalo.
When Torregrossa fed rats diets containing bitter-tasting additives, she observed noticeable increases in multiple categories of saliva proteins.
As those changes happened, rats became more likely to accept the bitterness in their food.
""The way we think about this is, if you eat broccoli all the time, broccoli doesn't taste bad to you,"" says Torregrossa.In another experiment, Torregrossa used catheters to transfer saliva collected from rats that were accustomed to eating bitter diets into the mouths of rats that were not.
The naive animals became more tolerant of bitter food, despite their lack of exposure.
But control animals that weren't supplied with the pumped-in, bitterness-tolerant saliva proteins still rejected the bitter food.Torregrossa says she and her team have yet to figure out exactly which proteins are responsible for this tolerance.
They have a couple of likely candidates, including proline-rich proteins and protease inhibitors, but there could be others.
They need to know which proteins are involved before they can assess how responses to bitter flavours are being tweaked in the mouth and the brain.The bubbles in soda drinks may help mask the sweetness of drinks, which become more pronounced when they go flat (Credit: Catherine Falls Commercial/Getty Images)Of course, rats aren't people – but researchers have found hints that saliva is doing similar things to taste perception in people, though the picture is more complicated.
""There are a lot of other things in human diets and experiences that are influencing our day-to-day experience, particularly with foods and flavours, that rodents just do not have to deal with,"" says Lissa Davis, a sensory and nutrition scientist at Purdue University who studies taste and behaviour.But if these patterns can be decoded and understood, the potential is great, says Lamy.
If you could somehow provide kids with an additive that encourages changes to their saliva and therefore makes their experience with a bitter vegetable more palatable, it could encourage healthier eating.
If their first experience with a new food isn't accompanied by a high level of bitterness, she says, ""probably they will associate a good experience with that vegetable"".More broadly, building a better understanding of how saliva influences taste – and how diet, in turn, influences the composition of saliva – could open up a host of new ways to nudge dietary preferences toward healthy foods that are often reviled.
""How,"" says Torregrossa, ""can we turn the haters into people who love these foods?
That's what I'm obsessed with.

future,"When I was five years old, my grandmother gave my younger sister and me a picture book which outlined in detail how a man and a woman have sex to create a baby.We were enthralled.
Until this point, our only reference point for where babies came from was Disney's Dumbo being delivered to his mother by a stork.My embarrassed mum placed the book on a high shelf, hoping that would be the end of it.
My sister and I, of course, climbed on a chair to get it and continued perusing the pictures, giggling and pointing incredulously at the naked bodies, as my parents awkwardly tried to dodge our barrage of questions.My parents had ""the talk"" with me a few years later, when they thought I was the right age​​ to learn the truth about sex, childbirth and puberty.
Sex education was also part of the curriculum at both the Dutch and English primary schools I attended.
But many children across the world aren't properly taught about sex until they get to secondary school, if at all.
""There are definitely still plenty of children who are getting folk stories or mythical answers about where babies come from,"" says Lucy Emmerson, chief executive of the Sex Education Forum in the UK.Could such myths and euphemisms – whether they are classic tales of babies delivered by storks or found in cabbage fields, or more modern, spontaneous inventions – actually affect our attitudes to sex in the long run?
And how did they come to be in the first place?
A closer look at some of the oldest folk stories about sex and babies reveals fascinating insights into why people tell them – and how we might do better.In Scotland, children placed cabbage leaves outside their homes to ask fairies to bring them a new sibling (Credit: Emmanuel Lafont)The baby-stealing craneGrowing up, I was frequently confronted with the stork tale.
Disney films, cartoons and picture books all told me that newborn babies were found and delivered to their parents by these elegant, long-legged birds.
The original myth, however, has a darker twist, with the bird stealing – or rescuing, depending on your perspective – the baby.The myth can be traced back to ancient Greece, where cranes, which share many similarities with storks, were associated with stealing babies.
In Greek mythology, Hera, the goddess of childbirth, turned her rival Gerana into a crane with an elongated neck because she was having an affair with her husband Zeus.
Unwilling to part with her newborn child, Gerana picked up the baby, wrapped it in a blanket, and flew off with the infant in her beak.Over time, the crane was conflated with the stork, says Paul Quinn, senior lecturer in English literature at the University of Chichester in the UK.
""There's a link with domesticity because storks nest on people's roofs.""
Another mythological layer was added by the pelican, which in European medieval literature was a symbol for the Virgin Mary and the nurturing mother, says Quinn.
The pelican was also associated with breastfeeding, he says, as the bird is described as picking at its chest to feed its chicks in literature.By the early 19th Century, the stork started appearing in fairytales.
Again, it tended to appear as a symbol of domestic life and the family.
""Storks have always been associated with family life because they were visibly seen nursing their young,"" says Marina Warner, professor of English and creative writing at Birkbeck College, University of London.
In fairytales, they often come to the rescue of human babies.
""The stork finds babies in wells, ponds or marshes and with her beak she pulls the babies out and bundles them in a sling,"" says Warner.This version was popularised by Hans Christian Andersen's story The Storks, which was published in the early 19th Century.
In Andersen's tale, the white birds seek out ""the pond in which all the little children lie, waiting till the storks come to take them to their parents"".
""The prettiest little babies lie there dreaming more sweetly than they will ever dream in the time to come,"" Andersen writes.
""All parents are glad to have a little child, and children are so pleased with a little brother or sister.
""But there is a cruel twist to Andersen's story: badly behaved children are given a dead baby sibling by the stork as punishment, to make them cry over their ""little dead brother"".Despite this horrific ending, Andersen's tale quickly swept through the English-speaking world.
In Victorian Britain, the stork became a useful way for embarrassed parents to explain the facts of life to their children and conceal the realities of sex and childbirth, says Warner.In its benign form, the stork myth still lingers in popular culture.
To this day, a common birthmark on a newborn's skin, caused by blood vessel malformations, is still called a ""stork bite"", highlighting the tale's influence.A similar confluence of ancient beliefs and parental squeamishness lies behind another colourful myth about how babies are born: the idea that they are grown in cabbage patches.The cabbage patch myth possibly originates in various beliefs and practices around plants and fertility.
In Scotland, it was common for children to place cabbage leaves outside their homes if they were asking fairies to bring them a new sibling, says Quinn.
Women also used to eat cabbages to boost their fertility and ensure a successful pregnancy, he says.Just like the child rescued by the stork, the cabbage patch baby is ""found in nature and discovered as part of the natural world"", says Warner.
In French the term of endearment for a young child is ""mon petit chou"" (""my little cabbage""), she notes.The story also lends itself to sweet, child-friendly illustrations.
A series of postcards published in 1906 by three sisters in New Zealand show a gardener tending to a field of babies growing in cabbage patches.
Well-dressed Edwardian couples are shown wandering among the fields, browsing the babies growing there.
The gardener picks the chosen cabbage baby and presents it to the couple.
Similar tales of children being grown in gardens and orchards exist around the world, such as a much-loved Japanese folk myth about a boy emerging from a peach.For Victorian parents, tales featuring the stork and cabbage patch babies offered a ""way to explain things to their children that they couldn't explain to them otherwise"", says Quinn.
""They didn't know what a female body looked like inside … they just imagined it to be an inverted male body,"" he says.
""So how do you explain that?
The natural world is the obvious model to go to.
""For Victorians, the story of Little Red Riding Hood contained an important message about the risk of talking to strangers (Credit: Emmanuel Lafont)Warner agrees: ""A lot of parents wouldn't have understood their own anatomy and would have really struggled to explain the facts of life to their children.""
The tales provided a handy answer.
But parents also used them to transmit coded messages about sex and relationships, she says.Take Little Red Riding Hood, a European fairy tale about a girl who goes to visit her granny, and on the way, stops to talk to a seemingly friendly wolf.
During the Victorian Age, parents would tell their daughters this fairytale to warn them not to interact with men they didn't know, says Warner.
This was before women had access to any contraception so when it came to romance and pre-marital sex, ""the dangers were very great"", she says.
There was also ""real social shame"" associated with unmarried pregnancy, she adds.Harmful myths?While the baby-delivering stork remains a popular motif on greeting cards and gifts, it may be hard to imagine 21st Century parents seriously trying to persuade their children that this is how babies are born.
But other myths and euphemisms are still surprisingly common, says Spring Chenoa Cooper, associate professor of sexual health at the City University of New York School of Public Health.
One reason is simply that many parents are still unsure when and how to talk about the facts.
""A lot of people don't know the actual scientific things they should be saying and they don't know how to explain sex to their children.
""However, euphemisms that feel comforting and safe for parents in the moment can in fact be confusing for children, says Emmerson at the Sex Education Forum in the UK.
Parents may find it difficult to correct the story later, and admit that they lied.
She recounts how an 18-year-old girl visited a sexual health clinic to ask whether she could be pregnant after semen landed in her belly button.
""She was engaging in a relationship but she didn't understand sexual health or her own anatomy,"" says Emmerson.Cooper agrees that ""when people make assumptions based on myths and misinformation, it can have harmful results"".In Australia, the HPV vaccine, which is given to young people to prevent cervical cancer, was commonly referred to as the ""sex vaccine"".
This led some girls to wrongly believe that it protected them from sexually transmitted diseases and meant they and their partners did not need to use condoms, says Cooper.Another danger of using euphemisms is that it can set a pattern of not discussing sex openly, experts say, making it difficult for children and teens to confide in their parents.
""They might experience assault, and feel they cannot speak up about it, get pregnant and not tell anybody or get a sexually transmitted disease and not treat it,"" says Cooper.
""The fear of talking about these things can cause ramifications for their whole lives.
""The stork story can be traced back to ancient Greek myths about cranes transporting babies (Credit: Emmanuel Lafont)This article is part of Family Tree, a series that explores the issues and opportunities families around the world face today – and how they'll shape tomorrow.

In the US, just 29 of the 50 states mandate sex education.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, fewer than half of high schools and less than one-fifth of middle schools teach key topics for sex education.
In the UK, children are taught about relationships in primary school, but it is not compulsory for primary schools to provide sex education classes, which only become mandatory at secondary school.But Emmerson says some school resources in the UK are failing to properly teach children about sex.One example is the video ""consent, it's simple as tea"" which was created by Thames Valley Police and is widely shown in schools, she says.
The video likens initiating sex to offering to make someone a cup of tea and reminds young people that someone wanting a cup of tea (or sex) one day doesn't automatically mean they want it another day.Emmerson says she has received complaints from young people that the video is ""too euphemistic and fails to refer to sex at all"".
""So if a parent was thinking 'if I say nothing, they're going to understand that when they arrive at school', that is probably not the case,"" says Emmerson.It seems that my grandma was right, then, in giving me that picture book about sex and babies.
But for parents who can't quite imagine that level of openness and factual detail, researchers suggest starting small, with short, simple chats rather than a big talk.
It is about ""anticipating rather than being caught out"", says Emmerson.
""[It's about] realising that a lot of opportunities will present themselves before reception or nursery to give their children some vocabulary around their bodies and also around their emotions.
""For example, if a young child asks how babies are born, ""it's enough to say that the baby grows in the mother's tummy and comes out of the vagina,"" she says.
""It's not about explaining sexual intercourse.
It's just about providing a factual response that isn't a fabrication.
""""Whenever a child asks you a question about sex, answer it very simply and directly,"" says Cooper.
""You don't need to sit them down and lecture them for an hour… that might scare them to ask more about it.""
Vital concepts like consent and boundaries can be taught from the start.
For example, you can tell toddlers to check before hugging others and explain to them why asking for consent is important, she says.Does that mean there's no place for charming stories about storks and cabbages in modern parenting culture?
The answer might be, perhaps, to enjoy these folk tales for what they are – colourful feats of the imagination, handed down by previous generations.
In any case, my grandma's book delighted and entertained me as much as any fairy tale – and was certainly more thrilling than the story of the stork.

future,"One day, Harold Antoine Des Voeux realised he lacked a word.
It was the beginning of the 20th Century, and the doctor had been treating multiple people for lung ailments.
Gradually, he figured out the reason for the excess illness he was seeing: it was the air pollution caused by nearby factories burning so much coal.
In one 1909 incident that affected Glasgow, more than 1,000 people had died.There was no name for this pollution, so Des Voeux coined one: ""smog"" – a portmanteau of smoke and fog.
""He didn't ask for permission.
He didn't consult a linguist.
He just put it in his paper and announced it,"" says Heidi Quante, an artist who specialises in new environmental vocabulary.
""It became a neologism, because people were desperate to name what was in the air.
""­It wouldn't be the last time that a new word was needed to describe environmental change.
It's why Quante and her fellow artist Alicia Escott have spent almost a decade collecting and creating new words to define the experience of living in the Anthropocene (which, of course is itself a neologism, popularised in the 2000s.
)Quante and Escott call their project The Bureau of Linguistical Reality, and their goal is to co-create a new lexicon for a time of climate change, biodiversity collapse and other transformations in the natural world.
Through public participation and pop-up installations at places like climate summits, they ask people to help them come up with brand new vocabulary.
You might not have used words like nonnapaura, chuco헐sol, or preuphoreau before – but you may do soon.You may also like:Quante and Escott have been working on The Bureau of Linguistical Reality since 2014.
A founding motivation for the pair was a belief that the discussion of climate change needed to be participatory, not a one-way lecture.
""One of the things that frustrated me so much while working for major environmental groups is this concept that there are anointed people who 'know' and there are people who are 'not knowing',"" says Quante.
""But with the Bureau, everyone has knowledge: if you have a feeling you have knowledge; if you have an experience, you have knowledge.
""So, Quante and Escott see it as important to work with members of the public to coin words, rather than dreaming up new vocabulary on their own.Capturing the conflicting fears and hopes of becoming a grandparent amid climate change, ""nonnapaura"" comes from Italian (Credit: Javier Hirschfeld)To illustrate how, the pair tell the story of how the word nonnapaura was coined.
At an event they attended, a woman called Linda Ruth Cutts came up to them, and explained an emotion about climate change that she couldn't quite articulate.
""She said: 'I am terrified for my children… but I'm simultaneously wanting to experience grandchildren.
I don't know how to share that with them.'
It was simultaneous hope and fear,"" says Quante.So, working with Cutts, they turned to Italian, combining the word nonna (grandmother) and paura (fear): nonnapaura.Indeed, much of the inspiration for their words comes from non-English tongues.
""I grew up speaking three languages, and was always frustrated that the English language was so anaemic compared to French or others where there's a lot more emotions,"" says Quante.Another non-English neologism came from a conversation with two young people of El Salvadorian and Korean origin in Los Angeles.
There had been some tensions between their respective communities, explains Escott, so they wanted a word that helped remind them of what they had in common.
They came up with chuco헐sol  – a mixture of El Salvadorian slang, Korean and Spanish.
It essentially means ""dirty – wow – Sun"", and describes the Los Angeles sunset.A mixture of languages, ""chuco헐sol"" means ""dirty-wow-Sun"", and applies to the polluted Los Angeles sunset (Credit: Javier Hirschfeld)""Los Angeles has these gorgeous sunsets that are perfect for Instagram.
They're orange, they're red.
But the reason they're so beautiful is because of the pollution in the air,"" explains Quante.
""They wanted to say, 'We all look at the same Sun, we all experience the same pollution'.
They created a word to embody this experience.
""We didn't ask them to change their mother tongues; we didn't ask them to adhere to some rules of the English language,"" she continues.
""We let them do it in a way that they felt literally represented what they were trying to say.
They got so much joy out of just putting these languages together.
""While The Bureau of Linguistical Reality coins many of its words at live events, in conversation with people, its founders do also take submissions.
If you have an idea for a word that describes life in the Anthropocene, complete this form on its website.It wouldn't be the only word that Escott and Quante would unearth for environmental change in California.
In 2018, they and a contributor called Jessica Decker coined the word pyrora – to describe the air during Californian wildfires, when the atmosphere takes on a different hue due to the soot particulates within it.And when the pair visited the community of Pacifica, near San Francisco, they co-created words about the experience of living on land that was slowly being eaten away by the ocean.
""Pacifica is on the forefront of navigating coastal erosion, sea level rise and fraught conversations around the topic of planning for the future and 'managed retreat',"" says Escott.The term 'mientierra', derived from Spanish, describes the way that ground cannot always be trusted or relied upon – it applies to ideas or systems too (Credit: Javier Hirschfeld)The pair collaborated with Cindy Abbott of the Sanchez Art Center in Pacifica, as well as the artists Kim Anno and Modesto Covarrubias, who are both from the San Francisco Bay area, to work with local people on new terms to describe the situation they are facing.
Together they coined terms like sandulate, a verb which means to ""understand that the coast is alive, and we can't just build the solid structures that we have; respecting it"", says Quante.
Or mientierra – from the Spanish miente (she/he lies) and tierra (land).
It means ""a false sense of solid ground beneath us"", says Escott, to describe the experience of not being able to trust the land near a retreating coastline.
It could also be applied as a metaphor for contemporary structures and systems that seem robust, but are not.The human relationship with water also informed their word shellaqua, which is particularly relevant to the recent flooding across California.
Shellaqua is the act of covering a once-permeable surface with human-made materials like tarmac, increasing flood risk (based on a ""shellac"" coating and ""aqua"").
But it also has an allegorical meaning: an individual can shellaqua themselves, becoming impermeable and resistant to restorative ideas and thinking.Then there are the words that describe hubristic, or perhaps misguided, responses to climate change.
One of those is teuchnikskreis, which came from a conversation with a German engineer about the limitations of technology.
""There's a concept in German called the 'devil's circle', teufelskrieis,"" says Quante.
""He switched it to 'teuchnik'"", referencing the word for technology, technik.
So, teuchnikskreis is the ""false belief that creating technology will get us out of our mess, when in fact, our mess is cultural"", explains Quante.Another is marsification, which describes the expansion of colonial ideas to other planets.
Its creators – Zara Zimbardo of the consultancy Partners for Collaborative Change in California and Oakland-based writer-activist Patrick Reinsborough – wanted a word to help them describe what they saw as a mistaken attitude that Mars could one day be a refuge from climate change and all of Earth's problems.
""Preuphoreau"" is a hopeful feeling - the bodily intuition that refreshing rainfall may be coming (Credit: Javier Hirschfeld)My own favourite words from the Bureau, however, are the more hopeful ones.
For example, the word refuvescence  – coined with Zimbardo and San Francisco-based artist Georgia Carbone in 2017 – describes a moment when things take an unexpected turn for the better.
It echoes the word eucatastrophe, which I wrote about earlier in the Wise Words series, but is decidedly more organic in its origins.
""There is this moment where compost goes from smelling rank, to smelling sweet and full of life.
[Refuvescence] is thinking about that as a moment within culture,"" says Escott.I also like the word preuphoreau, coined with scientist Faith Kearns of the California Institute for Water Resources, which is the bodily feeling of sensing a change in the atmosphere because rain is coming.
It can also describe a moment of hopeful anticipation that change is coming.
It's a mixture of pre + euphoria + eau (French for water).Hopeful, sad, overwhelmed or pessimistic, Quante and Escott argue that when people have the opportunity to describe their emotions with new words, they feel more connected to what is happening in the Anthropocene.
And ultimately this leaves them more empowered in the face of daunting transformations.
(Learn more about the complex emotions that climate change is fostering in people around the world in our series Climate Emotions.
)As Quante says: ""A lot of people come to us and they say, 'Oh, I finally feel like I have a place in the climate conversation' because heretofore they would imagine that you have to protest in the street with a sign, or you have to be a politician, or have to be a scientist.
But they have the agency to be culture-shifters through words.

future,"In the wild, one of the only known carriers of Mycobacterium leprae, the bacteria that causes leprosy, is a mammal that looks rather like a large rat with a long snout dressed in leathery armour – the nine-banded armadillo.
Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease, attacking the skin, nerves and mucous membranes.
This eventually leads to white patches, numbness, muscular weakness and paralysis.
But despite its devastating consequences and recorded cases possibly stretching back as early as 1400 BC, to this day much about this ancient malady remains mysterious.
No one knows how leprosy originated, nor why some parts of the world are more affected than others.
Scientists still don't even know for sure how it spreads – and there still isn't an easy way to check if someone has it.
Take the armadillo.
Originally native to South America, this insect-eating animal is now also found across Central America and southern North America.
In Brazil, one of three countries that account for most of the 200,000 new leprosy cases every year alongside India and Indonesia, armadillos are hunted for meat.
One study by researchers found 62% of the armadillos killed by hunters were infected with M. leprae (similar surveys in the US – where there are between 150-250 new cases in humans reported each year – have found 20% of the animals there carry the bacterium).
In the US, they have been blamed for a rise in cases in Florida.
However, like much about leprosy, the degree to which armadillos are responsible for spreading the disease in humans is characteristically unclear.
That's not to mention the fact that humans may have given these animals the disease in the first place when Europeans brought it with them to Brazil around 500 years ago.
Why has leprosy remained so mysterious – and proved so hard to solve?
Crucially, could this be about to change?
Lost patients ""It's a very complex disease and much about leprosy remains a gripping puzzle, even today,"" says Gangadhar Sunkara, a drug development scientist and global program head at the pharmaceutical company Novartis.
In spite of significant advancements to contain the disease, up to three million people worldwide still live with leprosy and on average, 200,000 new cases are detected every year, according to figures by the World Health Organization (WHO).
However, in 2020, that number fell to 128,000 cases, says Cairns Smith, emeritus professor of public health at the University of Aberdeen and former director for Leprosy Mission.
Roughly 140,000 cases over two years have escaped detection as per WHO data, an oversight that is largely believed to be the result of the strain the Covid-19 pandemic has placed on healthcare systems around the world.Historically, it has been common in many cultures to quarantine people infected with leprosy in dedicated houses or hospitals – sometimes even on islands (Credit: Getty Images)""They haven't been diagnosed nor treated and are at severe risk to developing disability,"" says Smith.
Particularly concerning are the numbers of children who have not been diagnosed because of pandemic-related disruptions.
At least 15,000 of the cases detected worldwide every year affect children.
To catch the disease early would mean preventing life-long disability.
""However, these numbers [of children receiving a diagnosis] have dropped to 8,000-9,000 cases,"" he says.
""That means that there are a lot of children who are in danger of developing the disease.
Some countries are showing a recovery, but there is still low case detection in countries like Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Philippines.
At this time, we're really facing an acute challenge,"" he says.
The world has made great strides in leprosy treatment in the last four decades, especially with the WHO’s introduction of multi-drug therapy to treat multibacillary leprosy in 1982.
Multibacillary leprosy is a more advanced form of the disease, often characterised by skin lesions and disability.
One new treatment is multidrug therapy, (MDT) – a combination of three pills, two of which are taken once a month and another daily.
It has had a huge impact in terms of stopping the progression of the disease, bringing us as close to a cure as may be possible and preventing disability among those who are affected.
But it hasn't been able to stop new cases from emerging, explains Venkata Pemmaraju, acting team leader of the WHO global Leprosy Programme and who has been working on leprosy related issues for the past four decades.
Old challengesSo what makes this ancient disease so persistent?
According to Sunkara, there are a number of factors involved.
For one, M. leprae replicates extremely slowly, so it can take between two and 20 years before an infected person shows any symptoms of the disease.
The average incubation time (the time between exposure to the bacteria and symptoms first appearing) for the disease is five years, and in rare cases, a patient may have no symptoms for two decades.
It's not yet possible to grow the bacteria that causes leprosy in a petri dish, so researchers use armadillos to study it (Credit: Getty Images)""This bacteria has a longer incubation time,"" says Sunkara.
""It takes about 14 days for one bacteria to divide into two in the body, as compared to other disease causing bacteria which can double in minutes,"" says Sunkara.
For comparison, in optimal conditions the common gut bacteria Escherichia coli, some strains of which cause cases of food poisoning, can divide once every 20 minutes.The long incubation time is problematic not just for the patient, but also those around them.
During this time, a patient who doesn't know that they've been infected can pass on the infection to others, particularly to close contacts such as family members.Once a leprosy infection has become established and developed into the multibacillary form, it can take up to two years to treat, even with a combination of antibiotics.
Another issue is antibiotic resistance.
The original treatment for leprosy was the antibiotic dapsone, which was discovered to be effective against the bacteria in the 1940s – before then, it was incurable.
However, by the 1960s, this drug was becoming less effective.
Today there are several more effective options, particularly the antibiotic rifampicin.
The modern approach of using several antibiotics together was partly designed to prevent resistance developing again, but this remains an ongoing concern.
On the other hand, with early diagnosis and treatment, leprosy is an order of magnitude easier to eliminate.
Unfortunately, diagnosing leprosy is extremely difficult.
At the moment, the standard method is to take a biopsy.
With this technique, a tiny incision is made on a skin lesion, through which blood is squeezed out and tissue fluid and pulp are collected for testing under the microscope.
But this method is laborious and expensive, requiring a laboratory and technical expertise.
This is particularly challenging in rural areas, where laboratory facilities are not always available, as well as in low-income countries where leprosy is prevalent and resources are scarce.
""As a result, many patients are diagnosed late in the course of the disease when nerve and skin damage has already occurred,"" says Sunkara.Leprosy is much easier to cure if it's treated early (Credit: Alamy)The issue is compounded by the fact that scientists still don't know exactly how leprosy spreads.
It's surprisingly difficult to catch, and often requires many months of close contact with an infected person.
The current consensus is that it is likely to be transmitted via droplets in the air when someone coughs or sneezes, but there may be other routes such as through the skin.Recently scientists also found the bacteria in red squirrels living the UK, but despite extensive efforts, no other animal carriers have yet been found.
There have even been suggestions that red squirrels could have been responsible for spreading the disease in Medieval Europe.
Other possible natural reservoirs for the bacteria may exist and it has even been found to survive in soil according to samples analysed from the UK, Bangladesh and India.
However, as with armadillos, it's unclear how these wild pools of leprosy might be affecting its transmission in humans.
So, rather than going through the laborious diagnostic process, one option is to blanket-treat people who may have been exposed.
""In order to prevent the spread of leprosy, in 2018, the WHO introduced a significant intervention – close contacts of leprosy patients were tracked down and given a single dose of rifampicin,"" says Pemmaraju.
It was found to have a protective effect of around 55-60%.
However, because the pandemic disrupted diagnosis, leading to a missing 140,000 cases worldwide, this would have an impact on leprosy's spread.
""Assuming each leprosy patient has 10 contacts, that's over a 1.5 million people who are at risk of developing leprosy because they haven't been able to take a single dose of rifampicin,"" says Smith.Rifampicin treatment has had a significant impact in countries like Ghana, says Benedict Quao, who leads the National Leprosy Control Programme in Ghana, which is a member of the Global Partnership for Zero Leprosy.
""For the first time ever, countries had medical guidelines that could push political leadership to act,"" he says.
Though the Covid-19 pandemic is largely responsible for disruption to this new programme, it did introduce one useful new tool: contact tracing.
The method has been helpful in tracking down the contacts of leprosy patients in many areas so that they can receive a dose of the preventative antibiotic.
The snag is that some countries may not be able to mobilise enough resources for the regular delivery of rifampicin to contacts of leprosy patients, says Quao.
""In Ghana we've had that experience in six of our 16 regions and we want to ramp it up.
It is a good time for us to have this intervention, but it's not a perfect intervention.
Countries recognise that.
""It difficult to diagnose leprosy quickly, partly because the bacteria grows so slowly (Credit: Alamy)If an effective rapid diagnostic test were available – one that was non-invasive and effective, many of these missing cases of leprosy and close contacts of patients could be diagosed, without the need for blanket prescriptions of rifampicin to potentially healthy individuals.
The good news is that these diagnostic tests are currently under development – though they may not be available for some time.
To study the disease and its progression and develop diagnostic tests, scientists often need to inject M. leprae into armadillos, a technique that was first attempted in 1971.
""The fact that we cannot culture [grow] this bacteria so easily in laboratory settings is another factor hindering the progress of developing these tests,"" says Sunkara.
New horizonsSince 2000, Novartis Foundation has partnered with the WHO, supplying drugs free of cost globally for multi-drug therapy.
In February 2022, they partnered with Fiocruz for a study that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate leprosy diagnosis.
""I call it applying state-of-the-art technology to an ancient disease,"" says Sunkara.
There are at least 20-30 other skin diseases that present as white patches on the skin, says Sunkara.
Using the AI algorithm to analyse the way light reflects differently off the surface of each skin disease, it's possible to identify leprosy cases, distinguishing them from other similar conditions with far more accuracy.
Their study, published in Lancet Regional Health, pegged the accuracy at 90% – but with 1,229 skin images, the data set remains small at the moment.
If it succeeds on a larger scale, it might one day be a useful tool to help speed up diagnosis and treatment.
Continuing stigmaWhile modern advances in the treatment and diagnosis of leprosy have been life-changing for many patients, there's one problem that has never quite gone away: relentless discrimination.
""Leprosy remains a deep-rooted human rights issue,"" says Alice Cruz, the UN Special Rapporteur on the elimination of discrimination against persons affected by leprosy, a role she's held since November 2017.
There are more than a hundred laws that discriminate against people with leprosy worldwide, creating a strong stigma that can act as a barrier for getting treatment, she says.
In some countries, leprosy is grounds for divorce.
In India, this was the case until laws were amended in 2019.
Many people affected by the disease still struggle to get jobs, and the disease can hinder their access to healthcare and education.
""Countries should do everything in their power to have discriminatory laws abolished and to put in place policy that can guarantee economic and social rights to people affected by leprosy,"" says Cruz.
""Going forward, we should ask ourselves the question: are our healthcare systems working to afford full accessibility to persons affected by leprosy?
This is because leprosy is much more than a disease, it became a label that dehumanises people who are affected by it.
""* This article was updated on 25 January 2023 to correct an error that stated nine-banded armadillos were endemic to Southern and Central United states and native to India and Indonesia.
A clarification that red squirrels in the UK have also been found to carry the bacterium responsible for leprosy was also added.

future,"Anzère is often hailed as Europe's greenest ski resort.
But the Swiss village had a difficult start to its 2023 winter season.
Like many other Alpine ski resorts, low-lying Anzère was forced to close some of its pistes due to lack of snowfall and rainy conditions in late December and the first few days of January.The Alps experienced record high temperatures over Christmas and New Year, reaching 20.9C (70F) in northwest Switzerland.
""It was exceptionally warm over Christmas and New Year,"" says Stephanie Dijkman, director of Anzère tourism.
""Nearly all the snow in the village was gone.
I was quite worried.""
People were unable to ski down to the village, she adds.Fortunately, it started snowing again in early January, just in time for the arrival of the ""real skiing fans"" who book their trips outside of the holiday season and are hoping for ""very good conditions"", she says.But the recent warm weather and winter washout throughout the Alps is an omen of what awaits the ski industry.
Many resorts are aware that they only have two options: close or adapt their business model to cope with mounting climate threats.From the Swiss Alps to the Rocky Mountains, resorts are grappling with the impacts of climate change by trying to provide sufficient snow cover and rapidly adapt to the changing conditions, while envisaging what their future looks like in a warming world.Besides measures to reduce its own emissions, such as by investing in renewable energy and building Europe's largest wood-fired heating plant, Anzère is planning ahead for a time where skiing may no longer be viable.
""We're aware that we need to adapt the resort for the years to come,"" says Dijkman.
""We're investing more in bike trails, in climbing [routes] and walking paths and highlighting all that we have to offer, whether it's in the summer or winter.
""Climate change is turning skiing into an endangered pastime.
Ski seasons are becoming shorter and slopes are turning green as temperatures rise.
Heavy rainfall in Alpine resorts contributed to snow melting and slushy conditions.When temperatures rise, the atmosphere ends up holding more water vapour which leads to more rainfall, says Marie Cavitte, a glaciologist and climate researcher at the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium.
""[When] temperatures increase, [water vapour] falls as rain instead of falling as snow,"" she adds.
""That is what is happening at low altitude ski stations, which are below 1,600m (5,250ft).
There we are seeing a lot more rain on snow events which increase the melting of existing snow.
""At low altitude resorts in Europe, snow depth is shrinking by 3-4cm (1.2-1.6in) every 10 years, says Cavitte.Ski seasons are becoming shorter and slopes are turning green as temperatures rise (Credit: Dietmar Stiplovsek / Getty Images)Another major concern is the rapid disappearance of glaciers.
Alpine resorts such as Tignes in France rely on glaciers for snow cover and water supply.
In the European Alps, glaciers are expected to vanish almost completely by 2100, with the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warning that they could lose 94% of their 2017 volume by the end of the century.
As temperatures rise, glacial ice melts faster and there is less fresh snow.
Glaciers melting could lead to severe flooding and erosion in the valley below and increase the risk of avalanches, destroying critical infrastructure as well as significantly reducing water supplies for local mountain communities.According to a 2017 study by the Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research, the Alps could lose up to 70% of their snow cover by 2100, if global temperatures rise in line with business-as-usual.
The world is currently on track for an average of 2.7C (4.9F) of warming by 2100.
If global temperature rise is kept below 2C (3.6F), though, the reduction in snow cover will be limited to 30%, according to the study.Rising temperatures and decreased snowfall are shortening the winter ski season, a concerning trend for the mountain communities whose livelihood depends on the winter sports industry.In a swathe of US ski resorts covering a combined area the size of Virginia, the ski season shrank by an average of 34 days between 1982 and 2016, according to a 2018 study.Anzère's winter season has shrunk by just a few days over the past 30 years, says Dijkman.
""But in some European resorts, [the season] has shortened by weeks and that is obviously going to have quite a big impact.
""A lack of snow isn't the only challenge that ski resorts are contending with.
""In the United States, wildfires are almost a greater threat,"" says Auden Schendler, senior vice president of sustainability at Aspen Skiing Company, which operates the Aspen Snowmass resort in Colorado.Over the past five years, wildfires have come dangerously close to towns and shut down major highways in the ski region.
""We're already seeing fires at ski resorts.
They're as big a threat as loss of snow,"" says Schendler, adding that in recent years the resort has also experienced mudslides caused by extreme rainfall.The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2.
The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view.
Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.Ski resorts are scrambling to ensure that they can stay open for their entire season and provide tourists with the snow-covered, picturesque settings they expect.To do this, they are harnessing huge snowmaking machines which cover the pistes in fresh white powder.A study by the University of Basel in Switzerland warns that resorts situated below 1,800-2,000m (5,900-6,600ft), will increasingly have to rely on artificial snow to keep just their higher ski slopes open for up to 100 consecutive days, while their lower slopes may not be possible to save.
This would raise their water consumption by 79% by 2100.
During an average winter towards the end of the century, a resort would consume about 540 million litres (119 million gallons) of water, compared to today's 300 million litres (66 million gallons).
In the French Alps, water consumption could increase ninefold by 2100, according to the study.This could lead to conflict between the skiing industry and local communities who may rely on the water for hydropower, the researchers warned.
(Read about how small hydropower plants have long sustained remote communities in the Alps).The study also predicts a huge rise in operational costs for ski resorts if they are forced to use artificial snowmaking to maintain their slopes.
This is because the cannons that distribute the snow and the ploughs that groom the pistes are incredibly energy-intensive and run on polluting fossil fuels.
There are currently no snow-making machines that run on renewables and plans to reduce overall emissions are focused around improving efficiency.Solutions to adapt to the changing climate in the mountains therefore ""ironically add more CO2 to the atmosphere and are making the climate problem worse"", says Cavitte.Even today, snow ploughs on average account for roughly 60% of a resort's carbon emissions, while snow cannons contribute about 25%, says Cavitte.
Ski lifts aren't as polluting, she says, since many resorts are trying to use renewable electricity.Besides the climate impact of snow machines, there is also an operational challenge as artificial snow can only be produced when temperatures stay below 1C (34F).
The air has to be cold enough that the water droplets which the machines expel freeze and turn into snow particles.Over Christmas and New Year, many Alpine resorts were forced to close their slopes as the temperatures were too high to generate artificial snow.Ski resorts are investing in mountain bike trails, walking paths and climbing routes to encourage tourists to visit in the summer (Credit: Alamy)Meanwhile, some have resorted to covering glaciers in protective blankets to stop them from melting in the summer.
Made out of white UV-resistant synthetic material, the blankets shield the thick winter snow from the Sun's rays during the warmer summer months.
According to a 2021 study, the technique can reduce the melting of snow and ice by 50-70%, compared to unprotected surfaces.But it is a costly process, the study's authors warn.
Covering all of Switzerland's 1,000 largest glaciers would cost about 1.4bn Swiss Francs ($1.5bn; £1.2bn) annually, they estimate.There are also negative environmental consequences associated with this adaptation measure, warns Cavitte.
Polluting machines are used to put the blankets down and remove them.
""And when they take them off, there's always pieces of plastic that are left behind which contaminate the glacier and surrounding land,"" she says.
There are also concerns about how this measure will impact local biodiversity and wildlife, she adds.
These short-term measures will not shield the industry from the looming climate threat.
""The ski industry is not going to be able to save itself,"" acknowledges Schendler.Despite this bleak outlook, many resorts have adopted ambitious, long-term sustainability goals in a bid to reduce their emissions and protect their natural resources.Big Sky resort, which sits at an elevation of 2,200m (7,200ft) in the Rocky Mountains in southern Montana, is aiming for net zero emissions by 2030, under its Forever Project, which was launched in 2021.
The resort has introduced a wide range of sustainability measures, including a newly installed 32 kilowatt (kW) solar array, improving the efficiency of buildings, reducing its water usage and protecting its forests, says Amy Fonte, sustainability specialist and head of the Forever Project.The resort also purchases renewable energy credits for the remaining electricity it uses, including for its 38 chairlifts and its housing, says Fonte.Aspen Skiing Company, meanwhile, is aiming to source 100% renewable electricity to power all its operations by 2030.
""Ski resorts use fossil fuels and a lot of energy.
It would be completely hypocritical if those resorts were not working to fix the system,"" says Schendler.Meanwhile, a wood pellet plant heats 600 apartments, two hotels and a public swimming pool in Anzère, saving the village 1.5 million litres (330,000 gallons) of oil a year.
Most of the resort already runs on hydroelectricity, which is generated at the nearby Tseuzier dam.Anzère is also car-free and offers free public transport to all visitors, in a bid to encourage people to travel more sustainably.
Tourists also have a role to play in helping reduce emissions and preserving the mountains, says Dijkman.
""It's a mindset that needs to not only be present among local businesses but also among the people that come here on holiday.
""This starts with choosing how they travel to the ski resort.
According to a recent survey by the Ski Club of Great Britain, just 2% of British travellers take the train to go skiing, compared to 72% who fly.
(Read more about the climate impact of flying).
For people in Europe looking to travel in a more sustainable way to the Alps, there are plenty of options ranging from the Alpen Express, an overnight train travelling from the Netherlands via Cologne to Austrian resorts, or the TravelSki Express which runs between London and the French Alps, via a Eurostar to Paris.Even if they are unable to change their own fate, resorts can still play an important role in the fight against climate change, says Schendler.
""The role of the industry is to help the public understand what they stand to lose from climate change and to advocate for solutions.
""Ski resorts are the ""perfect messenger"" for highlighting the reality of the climate crisis, says Schendler.
""People love what skiing offers them today.
The threat of that disappearing is the kind of visceral hit that people need to catapult themselves into action.
""Fonte agrees that the ski industry ""can make significant behaviour changes…We can really help mitigate the impacts of climate change,"" she says.
""I'd like to think that we're going to live in a world where skiing will still be around.
""But this looks like an unlikely reality for many resorts, especially lower-lying ones in Europe.
Many are seeking to pivot their business model and ensure that they have a future if there is no more snow.Some ski resorts are covering glaciers in protective blankets to stop them from melting in the summer (Credit: Miguel Medina / Getty Images)""We're now investing more in summer [activities] than we're investing in winter [ones],"" says Dijkman.
The plan is to highlight ""all the activities that the mountains have to offer"", without turning the resort ""into a Disney [theme] park"", she says.Schendler says a future without skiing will be very difficult for resorts.
Even with increased investment, they will struggle to generate a similar stream of revenue during the summer, he argues.
""Skiing is a huge business,"" he says.
""The [economic] throughput in the summer is going to be much lower.
You can't really build a business around hiking.
""But according to Rachael Carver, who surveyed ski tourists at the Austrian resort Stubai Glacier for her dissertation at the University of Staffordshire in the UK, people see the value of visiting the mountains even if there is no snow.Some 70% of those surveyed said they would return to the resort if the glaciers vanished, citing the beautiful mountain scenery and hiking opportunities as the main reasons.Carver also observed an increase in ""last-chance tourism"" at Stubai Glacier, with people visiting the resort before the glacier vanishes completely.
""Many people are aware that glaciers are melting and that ski resorts are disappearing.
They want to see these sites before they [vanish] completely,"" she says.This increased interest in visiting glaciers provides resorts with an opportunity to educate people about climate change, she notes.
But this surge in ""last-chance tourism"" is also unsustainable and placing even more pressure on an already fragile ecosystem, says Carver.Adapting the business model and pivoting to new mountain activities is the only choice, says Dijkman.
""We have to become greener if we want to keep living here,"" she says.She is hopeful that tourists will continue visiting the mountains even if there is no snow.
""Our mountains are naturally stunning and we already have absolutely everything to make holidays perfect, whether it's in the winter or summer.""

They number in their trillions and include thousands of different species.
Many of these microorganisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukarya, were here long before humans, have evolved alongside us and now outnumber our own cells many times over.
Indeed, as John Cryan, a professor of anatomy and neuroscience at University College Cork, rather strikingly put it in a TEDx talk: ""When you go to the bathroom and shed some of these microbes, just think: you are becoming more human.
""Collectively, these microbial legions are known as the ""microbiota"" – and they play a well-established role in maintaining our physical health, from digestion and metabolism to immunity.
They also produce vital compounds the human body is incapable of manufacturing on its own.But what if they also had a hotline to our minds?

29 Reasons You Aren't And What To Do About It, we explore the dozens of internal and external factors that affect and manipulate the way we think, from genetics, personality and bias to technology, advertising and language.
And it turns out the microbes that call our bodies their home can have a surprising amount of control over our brains.
Over the last few decades, researchers have started to uncover curious, compelling – and sometimes controversial – evidence to suggest that the gut microbiota doesn't just help to keep our brains in prime working order by helping to free up nutrients for it from our food, but may also help to shape our very thoughts and behaviour.
Their findings may even  potentially bolster how we understand and lead to new treatments for a range of mental health conditions, from depression and anxiety to schizophrenia.The picture is still very far from complete, but in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has had a deleterious impact on people's mental health in many parts of the world, unpicking this puzzle could be more important than ever.Our guts are a menagerie of different species of bacteria, some of which appear to communicate with our brains (Credit: Rodolfo Parulan Jr/Getty Images)One of the research field's key origin stories took place in the North American wilderness – and, be warned, it makes for some stomach-churning reading.
The year was 1822 and a young trader named Alexis St Martin was loitering outside a trading post on what is now called Mackinac Island, in what is now Michigan, when a musket accidentally went off next to him, firing a shot into his side from less than a yard (91cm) away.
His injuries were so bad that part of his lungs, part of his stomach and a good portion of his breakfast that day spilled out through the wound in his left side.
Death seemed certain, but an army surgeon named William Beaumont rode to the rescue and saved St Martin's life, although it took the best part of a year and multiple rounds of surgery.What Beaumont couldn't repair, however, was the hole in his patient's stomach.
This persistent fistula would remain a grim and lasting legacy of the accident, but Beaumont wasn't one to pass up a good opportunity – however unpleasant.
Realising that the hole provided a unique window into the human gut, he spent years investigating the intricacies of St Martin's digestion.
Exactly how willing a volunteer St Martin was is open to debate as Beaumont employed him as a servant while conducting research on him – the murky arrangement almost certainly wouldn't be considered ethical today.
Among the findings Beaumont uncovered during his studies of St Martin's guts, however, included how they were affected by its owner's emotions, such as anger.Through this finding, Beaumont, who would go on to be lauded as the ""father of gastric physiology"", had hit upon the idea of a ""gut-brain axis"" – that the gut and the brain aren't entirely independent of one another but instead interact, with one influencing the other and vice versa.
And now we know that the microorganisms within our gut make this process even more complex and remarkable.
""More and more research is revealing that the gut microbiome can influence the brain and behaviour across a variety of different animals,"" says Elaine Hsiao, associate professor in integrative biology and physiology, at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).
How exactly our microbiota might be influencing our mind is a growing, pioneering and still relatively novel field.
But there have been advances over the last 20 years or so, particularly in animals.
And, slowly, a case is being built to suggest that these microorganisms aren't just a vital part of our physical selves, but also our mental and emotional selves, too.
""In medicine, we tend to compartmentalise the body,"" says Cryan.
""So, when we talk about issues with the brain, we tend to think about the neck upwards.
But we need to frame things evolutionarily.
It's important to remember that the microbes were here before humans existed, so we have evolved with these 'friends with benefits'.
There has never been a time when the brain existed without the signals coming from the microbes.
""What if these signals are actually really important in determining how we feel, how we behave and how we act?
And could we modulate these microbes therapeutically to improve thinking, behaviour and brain health?
""You might also like to read:Hsiao is one of the researchers leading the way in this field and her lab at UCLA has explored the part these microorganisms might play in everything from foetal brain development to cognition and neurological conditions such as epilepsy and depression.
She has also investigated how these microbes might be influencing our brains and thinking.
""Specific gut microbes can modulate the immune system in ways that impact the brain and also produce molecules that signal directly to neurons to regulate their activity,"" she says.
""We find that gut microbes can regulate the early development of neurons in ways that lead to lasting impacts on brain circuits and behaviours.
We also find that under shorter timescales, gut microbes can regulate the production of biochemicals, like serotonin, that actively stimulate neuronal activity.
""Indeed, research suggests our microbes may be communicating with our brains through numerous pathways, from immunity to biochemicals.
Another candidate is the vagus nerve, which acts as the superfast ""internet connection"" between our brain and internal organs, including the gut.
The bacteria Lactobacillus rhamnosus JB1, for example, appears to improve the mood of anxious and depressed mice.
This beneficial effect is removed, however, when the signals travelling along the vagus nerve are blocked, suggesting it could be being used as a communication pathway by the bacteria.William Beaumont's research on the digestive juices of Alexis St Martin gave some of the first hints of the interaction between our guts and brains (Credit: Getty Images)Much of the research in this field is conducted in mice (and other small animals).
And mice, of course, aren't humans.
But given the mindboggling complexities of establishing causality between microbial signals and changes in human thought and behaviour, animal studies have provided some intriguing insights into the strange interactions between bacteria and brain.
Research, for example, shows that ""germ-free"" rats and mice (those without any microbiota after being reared in sterile conditions) are more prone to anxiousness, and less sociable than those with an intact microbiota.
Germ-free mice, and those given antibiotics have also been found to be more hyperactive, prone to risky behaviour and less able to learn or remember.
Antibiotics, which can reduce the microbiota in an animal, also reduce shoaling behaviour in zebrafish, while probiotics boost it.Again, the human brain is vastly more complex than that of a rodent or fish, but they do share some similarities and can offer clues.
It makes sense that bacteria, wherever they live, might benefit from helping their hosts to be more sociable and less anxious.
By interacting with other people, for example, we help our bacteria spread.
And whether or not they're really pulling our strings, it's in our microbes' evolutionary interests to make their environment as conducive to survival as possible.But do communicative microbes, congregating zebrafish or friendly mice really matter?
Hopefully, yes, say the researchers.
Ultimately, a better understanding of these processes could lead us towards ground-breaking new treatments for a range of mental health conditions.
""We've coined the term 'psychobiotics' for [microbiota-based] interventions that have a beneficial effect on the human brain,"" says Cryan.
""And there are more and more of these psychobiotic approaches coming.
""There are caveats, of course.
While some strains of bacteria appear to have a positive effect on the human mind, many others don't and researchers have yet definitively to establish why – and how.
Humans are also unfathomably complex, and when it comes to thinking and mental health, there are countless other factors at play, from genetics and personality to the environment around us.
""We need many more large-scale human studies to take into account these individual differences,"" says Cryan.
""And maybe not everyone will respond to a single bacteria in the same way because everyone will have a slightly different baseline microbiota anyway.
""Disclaimers aside, however, more research could bring fresh hope.
""The good news is that you can change your microbiota, while there's not a whole lot you can do to change your genetics – except blame your parents and your grandparents,"" Cryan adds.
""The fact that you can modify your microbiota potentially gives you agency over your own health outcomes.""
Indeed, pro- and prebiotic supplements, simple dietary changes, such as eating more fermented foods and fibre – and even, perhaps, meditation – can help alter our microbiota in ways that benefit our minds.Philip Burnet, an associate professor in the University of Oxford's department of psychiatry, notes that many mental health conditions have been associated with changes in the microbiota.
Often, this imbalance or ""dysbiosis"" is characterised by a reduced amount of certain bacteria, particularly those that produce short-chain fatty acids (such as butyrate, which is widely believed to improve brain function) when they break down fibre in the gut.Indeed, a 2019 study by Mireia Valles-Colomer, a microbiologist at KU Leuven University of Leuven in Belgium at the time, and her colleagues found a correlation between the amount of these butyrate-producing bacteria and wellbeing.
Specifically, the researchers noted in the study that: ""Butyrate-producing Faecalibacterium and Coprococcus bacteria were consistently associated with higher quality of life indicators.
Together with Dialister, Coprococcus spp.
were also depleted in depression, even after correcting for the confounding effects of antidepressants.
""Antibiotics can change the shoaling behaviour of Zebrafish (Credit: Getty Images)Human studies on the communication between the gut, the brain and the microbiota are still relatively few and far between.
And Burnet urges caution: ""It is not known whether these altered levels in gut bacteria cause low mood or whether microbial numbers change because people who are depressed might modify their eating habits or eat less.
""Nevertheless, he has been exploring how prebiotics (which encourage bacteria to grow) and probiotics (live bacteria) might one day be used as psychobiotics to nurture populations of ""good"" bacteria – and treat a variety of mental health conditions.For example, one 2019 study by Burnet, Rita Baião, a psychologist also at the University of Oxford, and their colleagues uncovered some particularly interesting findings.
Although the study was funded by a company that manufactures probiotic bacteria, it used a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial – considered to be a gold standard study design during which neither participants nor researchers are aware whether they are receiving the treatment or not.
The researchers investigated the effect a multispecies probiotic might have on emotional processing and cognition in people with mild to moderate depression.
But the study also monitored their mood before and after the experiment using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), which measures depression severity.The participants, who weren't taking any other medication, were either given a placebo or a commercially available probiotic – which contained 14 species of bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium breve and Bifidobacterium infantis  for four weeks.The results were fascinating, not least that the participants on the probiotic experienced a significant subjective improvement in mood compared with the group on placebo, essentially becoming less depressed according to the PHQ-9.
Changes in the participants' levels of anxiety, which were also measured, were not observed.This was a small (71 participants), brief study and more research is needed to prove causality.
But it's an early indication that ""psychobiotics"" may one day be a helpful treatment for those with depression – particularly those who are reluctant to seek medical help or take traditional antidepressants, says Burnet.
Indeed, psychobiotics won't replace existing medications – but may eventually provide a helpful adjunct.
""They won't make everyone happier,"" says Burnet, but probiotics could one day complement more established mental health treatments.
""Only time will tell whether we will have psychobiotics,"" he adds.
""But the field is really moving forward...
This area of research is dominated by animal studies, however, so we do need more human studies using larger numbers of participants.
""But the potential of psychobiotics has captured imaginations.
""We also attracted a lot of interest from the public,"" adds Burnet.
""People are extremely interested in maintaining their health and wellbeing with natural supplements and encouraging the growth of good bacteria to support mental health has captured the imagination of the general public.
Especially now, when people are more anxious and depressed as a result of the pandemic.
""With Amy Chia-Ching Kao and others, Burnet has also explored the role these microorganisms might play in psychosis – and whether prebiotics (which help to promote the growth of bacteria in the gut) might help people with the condition think more clearly.
Many people are aware that psychosis can cause hallucinations, delusions and a detachment from reality.
But people with psychosis also often encounter difficulties with cognitive functions such as attention, memory and problem-solving, which can impact their ability to hold down jobs and relationships.
While medication can be used to treat the hallucinations and delusions, improving sufferers' cognitive impairments has proved more difficult.
A double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study by Burnet and Chia-Ching Kao, however, suggests a possible way forward.
""We found that giving a prebiotic to people with psychosis did improve cognitive function according to the clinical scales,"" says Burnet.At the start of the study, the participants were on medication and free of psychotic symptoms – but were still experiencing the cognitive impairment typical of psychosis.
Over 12 weeks, they were given a prebiotic or a placebo while their metabolism, immunity and level of cognitive impairment was measured over time.
At the end of the 12 weeks, they were then switched, so both groups had an equal amount of time on the prebiotic and the placebo.And the effect was small but significant.
The prebiotic improved overall cognitive function, particularly attention and problem solving, leading the researchers to conclude that the improvement was sufficient to boost social and mental wellbeing.
There was no evidence of the participants' immunity or metabolism changing so it wasn't clear how the prebiotic may have triggered this effect.
But it's another small step towards understanding the relationship between our microbiota and our mental health and the potential development of new treatments for disorders that affect our thinking.There are hints that the gut microbiota may affect cognitive skills more broadly, too.
It is well known that antibiotics disrupt the gut microbiota, but do they affect our cognition?
One recent study, which monitored the health and wellbeing of 14,542 female nurses for several years while they worked for the NHS in the UK, found that those who had used antibiotics for long periods of time (more than two months) scored lower on cognitive tests such as learning, working memory and attention tasks than those who hadn't taken such medication.
Importantly, the cognition of the women who had taken antibiotics was slightly poorer when they were followed up seven years later.
Although this is only a correlation, the researchers think it could be due to antibiotics-induced changes in the gut.Our gut microbes may even play a role in how sociable we are if research in rodents are to be believed – and we pick up microbes through contact with others (Credit: Getty Images)There's still a very long way to go, though, to understand this properly.
This is a fascinating but highly complex field, and research requires funding.
The rewards, however, could be profound.
""There are only a handful of specific microbes that have been studied so far,"" says Hsiao.
""Not necessarily because they are the most significant, but because we as scientists have much more to do to really understand the enormous diversity of microbes in the gut and how they function individually and as communities.
""I'm most excited about the opportunity to uncover new mechanistic understanding of how we and our microbial symbionts can work together to promote health and thwart disease.
""In the meantime, perhaps we should all pay a bit more attention to our microbiota.
A Mediterranean diet that's high in fibre, particularly from vegetables, is likely a good place to start.
And fermented foods, such as kimchi and kefir (a fermented milk drink) may also be beneficial.
In a small study with 45 participants, for example, Cryan and colleagues showed that those who were put on a diet that included a lot of fibre, prebiotics and fermented food (such as onions, yoghurt, kefir and sauerkraut), reported feeling less stressed than a control group which was on a different diet.
""What I like about fermented foods is that they democratise the science,"" says Cryan.
""They don't really cost much and you don't have to get them from some fancy store.
You can do it yourself.
In this field, we want to provide mental health solutions to people from all socioeconomic areas.
""The relationship we have with our microbiota is ""a bit like a federation"", adds Cryan.
""These microbes are our fellow travellers.""
We'd do well to remember that – for the sake of both our physical and, quite possibly, mental health.

future,"Scroll through parenting feeds on social media, and you'll soon come across so-called milestone cards: pastel-coloured cards marking a baby's first attempt at crawling, sitting up, or walking, along with their age.
It's not just on social media that developmental milestones have become something to celebrate – or stress over.
One recent poll, for example, found that around six in 10 US parents worried about their babies meeting their developmental milestones.
But few knew what should happen, when.Other parents may take the opposite approach and pay little attention to the timing of new skills, trusting that a child will develop at their own pace.Which raises the question: what is the point of milestones – and how should parents use them?
Are they a crucial tool that can help us spot early on when something is off track?
Or are they just another way for parents to ""one-up"" each other?The answers depend, partly, on what exactly we mean by milestones.
For a start, the reasons that healthcare professionals give for their importance can differ from parents' views.
""On a very concrete level, a milestone is a description of a behaviour of a child that parents either say their child can do, or cannot do,"" says Chris Sheldrick, a research associate professor at Boston University who focuses on paediatric screening protocols.He points to the literal meaning of the word itself.
If you're in a 10K race, at the 5K point, there might be a marker: a milestone.
By definition, at the start of the race, no-one has passed it.
By the end of the race, everyone has.Checking an individual baby's progress along those markers can help healthcare professionals assess their development.
But since parents know their child best, it can be a good idea for them to know roughly when babies tend to do things for the first time, experts say (though there are important caveats to the idea of typical development, to which we'll get later).When parents take a very relaxed view of milestones – assuming that their child hasn't yet tried crawling or walking simply because they have a more laid-back personality, for example – they may be missing other explanations, healthcare professionals say.Milestones can be a tool for spotting underlying problems, and offering the right support early on (Credit: Getty Images)This article is part of Family Tree, a series that explores the issues and opportunities families around the world face today – and how they'll shape tomorrow.
You might also like:""There are absolutely kids whose personalities impact what they're willing to do.
So they might be the ones that are trending towards that later side,"" says Kaitlin Rickerd, a paediatric physical therapist in New York.
""But when it starts to fall outside of the ranges of where it can be expected, there's usually something that needs to be addressed.
There's a reason, no matter how big or small it might be.
""Developmental delays are common, experienced by one in six children in the US.
A delay alone doesn't signify a medical condition – one review of 404 18-month-olds who weren't walking independently found that two-thirds had no underlying pathology, for example.When there is an issue, though, intervening as young as possible is key.
Delayed speech, for example, can be a signifier of autism, while late walking can be a sign of cerebral palsy.
Spotting such differences early can help parents understand and support their child's unique development.
""We know that in the first three years of life, the amount of brain growth, the amount of learning, the amount of milestones that a child is acquiring is huge – which also means it's our best window to get in there and make a difference,"" says Rickerd.But milestones are more than a tool for spotting underlying issues, she says.
After working in paediatrics with older children, she realised a failure to master one skill might have caused a cascade effect.
Take struggling to hold a pencil to write: it could relate to weakness in the arches of a child's hands, which could have been impacted by not weight-bearing as a baby, whether through crawling or tummy time, she says.This professional view of milestones primarily as a screening tool differs from how some parents treat milestones in everyday life: as a predictive, sometimes competitive, indicator of ability or talent.Indeed, there is some evidence that hitting certain milestones early can be indicative of a higher intelligence or attaining more education later.
But, says Sheldrick, this is true across whole populations, not specific children.
If there was a one-in-a-million chance of being a professional soccer player for a typically developing child, for an early walker, it might be one in 900,000, he says.Which milestones are marked and celebrated may vary hugely between cultures and even individual families (Credit: Getty Images)And pushing children to achieve milestones can backfire.
There is some evidence that frequent use of baby walkers and jumpers can impede motor development, for example.Even the metaphor of the race with each mile marked by a stone doesn't quite fit the complex reality of human development, Sheldrick points out.
If you're watching a race, you know which runners are exactly 1K behind the 5K milestone.
You can estimate when they'll hit it.
Once they do, you know the exact moment it happened.
And every runner who finishes the race will reach it at some point.Developmental milestones don't offer this clarity.
Nor are they a universal concept.
Their interpretation and definition may vary considerably between cultures – and even individual families.
""A good example is 'Can your child walk?
',"" Sheldrick says.
""What do you mean by 'walk'?
Can your child walk a mile?
Can they walk all the way to the well and back?
Have they taken a few steps?""
This confusion is why new screening tools, like the updated milestones recently put out by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), try to use more specific wording.Making it more complicated is that children develop very quickly.
A child that isn't walking at 18 months might be running by 19.
But if the child is only tested at 18 months, they might be identified as not being ""on track"".Then there's the issue of measurement.
How do you decide when something ""should"" happen?
And what data is that based on?The recent change to the CDC and AAP's milestones list highlighted many of these issues.
For nearly 20 years, like many other official milestone lists, they based milestones on the 50th percentile – if 50% of children could do something by a certain age, that was the age for that milestone.This meant that the other 50% of caregivers might worry unnecessarily.
It also encouraged paediatricians to take a ""wait and see"" approach for children who hadn't hit a milestone, which sometimes backfired.
""Parents of children with disabilities reported delays in identification because they were told to wait, that children develop differently, and that some take longer than others,"" researchers involved in the changes wrote.As a result, in early 2022 the CDC moved its benchmarking to the 75th percentile.
But the risk now runs the other way: with the ages set later, families might notice a child's delay later, too.Then there's the question of where these expectations come from.A boy in Chiapas, Mexico, stacks firewood – which in some families is an important milestone (Credit: Getty Images)Cultural differencesHistorically, there's been relatively little data on large populations of children and milestones.
In the 20th Century, psychologist Arnold Gesell pioneered quantifying motor milestones by observing babies from white, middle-class families from New Haven, Connecticut and describing their behaviour, movement and expressions over time.
Since then, much of the evidence on milestones has been based on Western populations.But early development can look very different in other cultures.In Tajikistan, for example, it's common to swaddle babies as old as two and leave them in a cradle, even awake.
Tajik children do acquire motor skills later than their Western counterparts.
But they seem to show no long-term ill effects.
On the other hand, in the Efe tribe of the Democratic Republic of Congo, babies as young as 11 months use machetes to cut fruit.
Suffice it to say that's not on the CDC list – nor do we worry whether US babies can do this.Parental expectations vary, too.
One older study from 1997 found, for example, that while European-American parents thought children should feed themselves by 13.7 months, Puerto Rican parents did at 19 months.
Staff at Unicef recently experienced these cultural complexities first-hand.
One of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals is that all children should be developmentally on track.
As a result, Unicef had to develop an instrument that every country could use.The question, says Unicef senior adviser Claudia Cappa, was, ""Can we come up with something that is the equivalent of growth standards?
Can we come up with a 'typical' child?
""The effort, which sprawled across than 200 national statistical offices, paediatricians, and child development experts, took five years.
One of the biggest challenges was how to make the questions universal.
In rural Mexico, for example, Unicef staff found they might get a blank look if they asked if a child could stack blocks.
They had more luck when they asked if a child could stack firewood.In one study highlighting the need for a cross-cultural perspective, the researchers are critical of the conventional view of milestones.
""Motor milestones are millstones to a 'whole-child' approach to development,"" they write.
""Motor milestones are only a perceived version of what is an important skill; they are cultural conventions, not universals.
""Today, child development experts are often aware of these limitations – and they are trying to correct them.
The CDC's updated list, for example, uses sources like a study of nearly 5,000 children in Argentina, India, South Africa, and Turkey.
Still, the question remains: how much data, and how many cultures, need to be represented for a list of milestones to truly be ""universal""?
And is that even possible?For parents, it might be worth remembering that milestones are meant to be helpful – not anxiety-inducing.
""Milestones are important.
They're worth paying attention to,"" Sheldrick says.
""If there's something that concerns you, I would follow up on it.
But don't freak out.
""Life, after all, is ""long and complicated"".
And it's unlikely to be defined by whether you walked by 18 months, or 20.---Amanda Ruggeri is a freelance science and features journalist.

future,"As child after child gasping for air was admitted to the hospital, Rabia Agha gritted her teeth.
In her role as director of the paediatric infectious diseases division at Maimonides Children's Hospital in New York, she had seen this before.
An outbreak of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) – a winter virus that can feel like a common cold in adults, but which can be dangerous for some young children.There was a wave last autumn – and an unexpected one in spring this year.
Now, in the early autumn months of 2022, it was back again.
""We've had to double the capacity of our ICU,"" she says, referring to the intensive care unit, reserved for the sickest patients.
Some of the children there have been put on mechanical ventilators to help them breathe.RSV typically hits the youngest children hardest but the patients Agha and her colleagues have treated lately tend to be approaching school age, around three or four years old.
In this age group, RSV would usually appear as a cold-like illness, with a runny nose and cough.
But now, some of them were struggling.RSV, strep A, the flu and other illnesses and infections are resurging among children, after having been mostly suppressed during the Covid-19 lockdowns.
Here's what doctors and health authorities say parents can do to keep children safe and healthy in the winter.The NHS and other health authorities recommend washing your hands with soap for 20 seconds to help stop the spread of viruses and bacteria, including strep A and RSV.
They also recommend being careful not to share potentially contaminated cups, towels or other items.Parents are advised to use tissues to help their children catch coughs or sneezes, then discard the used tissues as soon as possible and wash their hands with soap and warm water to stop the spread.Making sure your children's vaccinations are up to date can also protect them from a wide range of diseases – including the flu and many highly contagious and potentially dangerous diseases such as measles and polio.The step of giving preventative antibiotics, for example to protect children in the midst of a strep A outbreak at their school or nursery, needs to be carefully considered, doctors say, to avoid encouraging antibiotic resistance.
Superbugs created by antibiotics overuse have posed a particular threat to newborns, highlighting the need to use antibiotics with caution.
Plus, antibiotics have no effect on viruses such as RSV.
""Everyone is concerned, obviously, because older children tolerate this virus quite well – why were they not?""
she says.When Covid-19 rampaged across the world, many countries introduced strict lockdowns to thwart transmission of the virus.
Children were kept out of schools and nurseries for weeks or months on end.
Now that they are mixing again, doctors have noticed periodic surges in other diseases, including RSV, flu and illnesses caused by Group A streptococcus, a bacteria also known as strep A.Sixteen children have died in the UK since September following strep A infection.
According to the UK's Health Security Agency (UKHSA), during 2017-18, the last high season for strep A in the country, a total of 27 deaths in under 18s were recorded.
However, the 2022-23 season is not yet over.Epidemiologists continue to investigate whether Covid-19 lockdowns increased the likelihood of surges in other diseases, given that respiratory infections were more or less stopped in their tracks during the first year or so of the pandemic.
There is also the possibility that catching Covid-19 has increased children's susceptibility to other diseases by harming their immune systems somehow – though doctors say this is unlikely, as there is no evidence for such an effect.
But what exactly is going on?For weeks now, on routine conference calls with fellow doctors around the country, Ronny Cheung, a consultant paediatrician in London, has heard reports of strep A infections and respiratory viruses causing problems for children.
""It's been notable,"" he says.You may also be interested in:Although strep A, for example, is not usually life-threatening – it might simply cause a sore throat or tonsillitis – in rare cases, it can cause invasive, potentially deadly infections including meningitis.Cheung stresses that the recent deaths in the UK associated with strep A are extremely unusual: ""It doesn't make them any less tragic but it is really important to bear that in mind.
""There's a ""pretty good argument"" behind the idea that infections like this are spiking as a kind of delayed impact of the Covid-19 lockdowns, he suggests.
But it is difficult to unpick that from natural seasonal variability.What the data clearly shows is that, during 2020 and into 2021, the spread of respiratory viruses plummeted, explains Connor Bamford, a virologist at Queen's University, Belfast.
""We saw a real reduction in viruses, mostly RSV and influenza,"" he says.The UK Department of Health and Social Care confirmed this trend in March 2021.
And figures from Australia and Germany also show a flat-lining of respiratory viruses during the same period.Researchers then tracked unusual peaks in the months following.
A study in Germany found that levels of RSV in the country reached a record high between September and October 2021 – up to 50 times the prevalence recorded in the pre-pandemic years of 2017 to 2019.
Medical researchers in New Zealand also noticed a huge spike in RSV cases during 2021.Nicole Maison at the University Hospital Munich was lead author on the German study.
She, like Agha, has seen yet another resurgence of RSV this winter: ""We are currently seeing a significant increase in respiratory infections, especially respiratory syncytial virus, in Germany.""
She adds that she is working on a new paper about the situation.Besides clinical data, scientists have other ways of monitoring disease transmission.
For example, since 2021, Bamford and colleagues have been tracking the prevalence of RSV and flu virus material in wastewater, to better understand transmission of these pathogens in Northern Ireland.
Outbreaks are clearly visible in this data, he says.Keeping up to date with vaccinations is one way to limit the spread of infectious diseases such as flu, as well as Covid-19 (Credit: Getty Images)While our view of what's going on is getting sharper, many unanswered questions remain, including whether Covid-19 infection has actually affected children's immune systems in such a way that they are less able to fight off RSV, strep A, flu and other pathogens.
""We haven't seen any data to support that prior Covid infection decreases your immunity and that you will get a more severe subsequent infection of any other virus or even bacteria,"" says Agha.
She also says she would not, in general, expect to see long-term impacts on children's health or immunity as a result of what is happening now, though those who contract severe lung disease when very young might experience ongoing effects thereof.Either way, it remains important to protect children as best as possible, she adds.
Bamford suggests applying some social distancing, avoiding crowded places and wearing masks in some situations.
Improving ventilation indoors could also help.For strep A, it's possible to use preventative antibiotics in order to reduce the likelihood of infection within a nursery or school where there is a known risk.
But one would want this to be targeted, to avoid encouraging antibiotic resistance, says Clare Murray at the University of Manchester.
""Giving it to a whole school is probably over the top,"" she explains.
""Occasionally, we'll give a whole class a prophylaxis if there's been a lot of contact – it's not a new thing.
""Both Agha and Cheung expect that the intermittent spikes in childhood diseases that we are seeing post-lockdown will level out.
Hopefully things will be back more or less to normal as early as next year, Agha suggests.Since the Covid-19 lockdowns when many children were not able to go to school, there have been surges in certain childhood illnesses (Credit: Getty Images)Does all of this mean that Covid-19 lockdowns were a bad idea, and put children at risk unnecessarily?
""I absolutely refute that,"" says Cheung, noting that Covid-19 itself was extremely dangerous and caused large numbers of deaths.
Lockdowns, being so disruptive, were likely always going to affect people in negative ways – from the economic impact to effects on mental health and, apparently, disrupting immunity to other viruses.
""This is a cost that we knew we had to bear,"" adds Cheung.
""On balance, it was still the right course of action.""

future,"No one knew I was autistic as a child but, looking back, there were a number of sensory clues.
Apart from a tendency to repetitively stroke soft fabrics or run grains of sand through my fingers, I also found swirling and gentle rocking mesmerisingly soothing.When I was eventually diagnosed with autism much later in life – at the age of 60 – it gave me a new understanding of how and why I behave the way I do.
That includes certain childhood behaviours, from fabric-stroking to the way I played with toys and insisted on specific foods.
But it also raised questions, such as what might these preferences reveal about how children with autism experience the world?
And how could we use this understanding to help children fulfil their potential, form friendships, and enjoy life?As a science journalist, I naturally look to scientific research for answers – and there is a growing body of evidence providing fascinating new insights into behaviours that were long considered a mystery.Autism Spectrum Disorder, or autism, affects one in every 100 children, according to the World Health Organization.
A developmental condition caused by differences in the brain, it can affect how a person absorbs, processes and responds to information.
It is usually categorised along a spectrum, from mild to severe.
In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM 5), published by the American Psychiatric Association, this spectrum is divided into levels 1, 2 and 3, where those with level 3 autism require ""very substantial support"".
Within those categories, there is a huge diversity of needs and experiences, as well as some common traits.Take the swirling and rocking, for example.
These kinds of rhythmic repetitive actions – a common feature of autism – are known as self-stimulatory behaviour, or ""stimming"".
They can also include movements like hand flapping, foot shaking and finger flicking.
Even today, I can't resist fondling cashmere or faux fur clothes in shops and will often furtively touch the back of someone's irresistibly soft coat in public.
I also body rock occasionally, though only ever in private, because I know it makes most observers uncomfortable.Stimming can appear pointless or even disturbing to others.
As a result, there are various treatments aimed at changing or reducing it.
But as with many behaviours associated with autism, the person engaging in it is not necessarily experiencing what you might think.Sue Nelson as a child at a family event (Credit: Sue Nelson)While some forms of stimming can be harmful and should be addressed, such as a child hitting their head repeatedly against a wall, others are useful and helpful.
They are not out-of-control movements, but instead serve a purpose and can be a calming coping mechanism.
For me and many others, young and old, rocking reduces anxiety.
""It's something that's repetitive and soothing but even in the latest Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [DSM 5 by the American Psychiatric Association], the 'psychiatric Bible', these sorts of behaviours are classified as purposeless,"" says Steven Kapp, a developmental psychologist at the University of Portsmouth who was diagnosed with autism aged 13.
""So, I think a lot of researchers have struggled to understand why people engage in these behaviours.
""Kapp's autism helps inform his work and, in recent years, there has been an increasing attempt by other researchers to draw on autistic people's views of their own experience.
This can be very different from the impressions or judgments of those around them.For example, outside observers may interpret certain repetitive movements, including hand flapping, as a distress signal.
But 80% of respondents to a 2015 survey of people with autism reported that they enjoyed stimming.Kapp led a study of autistic adults to explore this behaviour further.
Many said they used stimming in response to sensory overload, including in ""confusing, unpredictable, overwhelming environments"" that caused them anxiety – which was then calmed by the movement.
But stimming was also used simply as a release of any high emotion, including happiness or excitement.However, the study participants tended to suppress these soothing and enjoyable movements in public.
Several had ""stimmed happily as young children"" but hid or changed the behaviour later, in adolescence, when they became aware that others judged them negatively for it, according to the study.
""There are plenty of autistic people who still engage in stimming,"" says Kapp.
""But we're less likely to do it in public because [others] often don't understand, so they stigmatise it.
When people do understand, they're more likely to accept it.
That's what the study I led found.""
The participants reported that when among accepting friends and family, they stimmed openly.Sue Nelson as a child with her father, grandmother and one of her brothers (Credit: Sue Nelson)Tomato soup and chocolate puddingSo-called repetitive restrictive behaviours (RRBs), which can include stimming as well as certain routines and rituals, can also affect family dynamics.
While my tendency as a child to constantly rearrange toys into categories such as size or colour rather than play with them – common among autistic children – didn't affect the family much, I suspect the only-eating-tomato-soup-and-chocolate-pudding phase was a bit more of an issue.
Fortunately, my parents accepted this and didn't turn the dinner table into a battle ground.In fact, many autistic children are labelled ""fussy eaters"".
One large study found seven out of 10 had atypical eating behaviours, the most common being limited food preferences.
Research also shows that children with autism are extremely sensitive to flavours, smell and textures.
It's that sensory perception aspect again and, for me, it's relatable.
After that initial restrictive food period during childhood, I am now addicted to a variety of highly spiced foods containing chilli and garlic.
However, I still find it difficult to eat a chopped egg sandwich without adding crisps for textured crunch, and just the thought of white fish in a white sauce on mashed potato makes me queasy.Of course, many people have food preferences and aversions, not only those with autism.
But the way such sensory experiences, emotional aspects and emotional regulation interact in people with autism, is still not fully understood.
This includes the emotional impact of sensory overload, which can be very powerful.Uta Frith, emeritus professor of cognitive development at University College London, has spent her career studying the behaviour of children with autism.
In the past, ""there was a theory that emotions were absent or disturbed in autism, which I think is just not true"", Frith says.
""On the contrary, emotions are very much in evidence, including high anxiety as well as anger and aggression.""
This can lead to tantrum-like meltdowns, often caused by sensory overload.Kapp says that when someone is overstimulated by light or sound, ""maybe removing oneself from the environment or getting out an accommodation like wearing headphones or sunglasses, or something to dull some of the sensation"" could help.
""Because a lot of autistic people are hypersensitive and will perceive it more painfully or sharply than others,"" he says.Friendship and connectionResearch – and especially, listening to the voices of people with autism – has also helped overturn a number of misconceptions, such as the common assumption that people with autism are not interested in social interactions.
As one study notes, the assumption that autistic people are solitary by nature is ""flatly contradicted by the testimony of many autistic people themselves"" – myself included.
The desire for solitude is usually, for me, only after socialising.
It's a mental recharging of batteries to balance stimulation overload.Certain behaviours, such as low levels of eye contact, may be seen as indicating a lack of social interest, but may actually be a sensory coping strategy, the study suggests.
Even researchers can fall into the trap of overly relying on eye contact as a measure of babies' and children's social engagement, some argue.When children with autism are asked about their experiences, they tend to report difficulties in understanding and forming relationships with other children, but also tend to say that they try to initiate such friendships and feel lonely if there is a lack of interaction.
""This suggests that children with these traits may benefit from careful monitoring and interventions focused at improving peer relationships,"" according to the authors of one study.
In short, children with autism do enjoy and benefit from friendships, but may need some help forming them.This can be easier when there is a way to meet the children on their own terms, research suggests – for example, by supporting another typical trait: special interests.Sue Nelson enjoyed specific sensory experiences as a child, such as stroking soft fabrics or running grains of sand through her fingers (Credit: Sue Nelson)Wildflowers, buttons, badges and spaceScientists are only beginning to understand how and why people with autism commonly form intense interests, and the benefits this can bring.
One study found that they develop an average of nine special interests, starting around the age of five.
These interests can include certain objects, music, computers, nature and gardening.As a child, mine were mathematics, wildflowers, science, buttons, badges, space and superheroes.
Not much has changed and, for others like me, pursuing their own interests generally has a positive effect on wellbeing and social contact.
When children and young people with autism engage with their passions this was found to have a wide range of benefits, such as boosting emotional and communication skills.There will always be activities that autistic children tend to instinctively dislike, even something as routine as haircuts.
I never enjoyed having my hair washed as a child and visiting a hairdresser remains an uncomfortable experience.
While I always ensure there will be no surprise head massage during a shampoo, I am anxious in case they forget.
For some, fear or distaste is induced by the sound of scissors or the feel of cut wet hair on the skin.
It's important to understand that these simple sensations, which many people enjoy, can cause others distress.What is often harder for parents is when their child doesn't want to engage in affectionate physical contact or hugging, due to differences in sensory processing and social communication.
Parents trying to play some kind of simple give-and-take game may find children with autism are not interested, and parents may find this hard.
""It's that turn taking, that reciprocation, a sort of copying [that children with autism may struggle with],"" says Frith.
""The easy understanding of what another person does.
""Individual enjoyment of social and physical contact can vary hugely.
Research into the effect of the Covid-19 lockdowns on children with autism, for instance, found that some children thrived while the behaviour of others worsened.
The wider social environment can also play a crucial part.Jess* lives in Hartlepool in the north of England.
Her eldest son was diagnosed with autism aged six, in 2015.
Since then he's been expelled from several schools after sensory overload led to meltdowns and aggressive behaviour.
""When the school system is completely flawed for tackling autism, a few fidget toys isn't going to work,"" says Jess.
""What worked was when he moved to a school with more space and a sensory room where kids could let rip.
""As a result of the increased space and understanding, her son's behaviour improved.
""The atmosphere was completely different and that made a difference.
There were teachers who believed in him and could communicate with him.
He could work outside the classroom if he wanted as they were much more flexible,"" Jess says.
""He still got excluded occasionally but we weren't seeing the same behavioural issues.
""Jess' son initially struggled with lockdowns.
Eventually, Jess stopped trying to persuade him to do his homework: ""He often went on long bike rides and was, therefore, much happier.
""Jane*, who lives with her husband in Aberdeen, Scotland, insisted throughout the pandemic that their teenage son, who has autism, continued to attend school.
He ""has transition issues so not leaving the house would have been his perfect scenario,"" she says.
""Each day I do lots of coaxing and reassurance and tell him things will be ok.
It doesn't work as well as it used to, but school is non-negotiable.
""Frith has observed that social attitudes about autism have shifted over the past few years, but not always in helpful ways.
""People have been through a cultural change in understanding neurodiversity and autism has become a favourite of fiction and films,"" says Frith.
""But it's focussed on very few features, in particular positive features.""
The kind of autism most often being presented in popular media would be categorised as mild, she says.
Also, on-screen characters with autism are often portrayed as being intellectually gifted.
The danger, she says, is that this misses out those who need more support.
""One thing we cannot completely overlook, but tends to be with some forms of autism, is that there can be an intellectual impairment,"" says Frith.
Acknowledging this can be an important part of accepting the child for who they are.For every family, learning about autism ultimately means learning about their child's unique experience of autism.
""There is greater understanding of neurodiversity, complex profiles and differences people may have rather than seeing autistic children as objects of pity or fear,"" says Kapp.
""But there is still a lot of work to be done.

future,"""Don't get dirty!""
was once a constant family refrain, as parents despairingly watched their children spoil their best clothes.
Whether they were running through farmers' fields, climbing trees or catching tadpoles, it was inevitable that children's whites would turn brown before the day was over.Today, many parents may secretly wish their children had the chance to pick up a bit of grime.
With the rise of urbanism, and the allure of video games and social media, contact with nature is much rarer than in the past.
For many, there is simply no opportunity to get muddy.What is gained in laundry bills may be lost in the child's wellbeing.
According to recent research, the dirt outside is teaming with friendly microorganisms that can train the immune system and build resilience to a range of illnesses, including allergies, asthma and even depression and anxiety.These findings show that outdoor exercise is not only beneficial because of the chance to roam free – but that certain natural materials, such as soil and mud, also contain surprisingly powerful microorganisms whose positive impact on children's health we are only beginning to fully understand.Kneading materials like mud or sand can help children develop the way their senses and movement interact (Credit: Getty Images)Mental restoration Many of the psychological benefits of outdoor play are already well established.
Our brains evolved in natural landscapes, and our perceptual systems are particularly well suited to wild outdoor spaces.This means that natural scenes provide the perfect level of stimulation, which is thought to help recharge the brain when it is tired and easily distractable.
Supporting this theory, one study from 2009 found that children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were better able to concentrate following a 20-minute walk in the park, compared to a 20-minute walk on the streets of a well-kept urban area.
Being in the proximity to grass and trees seemed to have had a beneficial effect on their minds.
The authors recommended using such ""doses of nature"" as a safe and accessible way of supporting children with ADHD, alongside other tools.Besides these restorative effects, outdoor play can offer valuable learning experiences.
For example, the act of moulding and kneading materials like mud or sand can help children develop the way their senses and movement interact, known as sensorimotor development, according to Francesco Vitrano, a child neuropsychiatrist, psychotherapist and lecturer at the University of Palermo, Italy, who has a long experience of applying these therapies.
This allows the child to gradually understand his or her bodily signals.Such activities – away from the house or classroom – may also help children to find ways to cope with emotions that may be hard to explore in other environments.
So-called ""sand tray therapy"", which involves using sand and miniature figurines to express one's thoughts and feelings, is an accepted form of counselling for children who are struggling to verbalise their emotional state.When it comes to the child's physical health, the most obvious advantage of outdoor play may be the exercise.
A child may find it easier to build up strength and stamina in a large open space resulting in a reduced risk of obesity, according to one study led by Elizabeth Gershoff, professor of human development and family sciences at the University of Texas at Austin, US.The latest findings, however, suggest there could be a host of other advantages to playing in natural environments – and the secret may be alive and wriggling around in the mud itself.Growing up in the countryside has been found to have long-term health benefits (Credit: Getty Images)Old friendsThe new research offers a fresh take on the ""hygiene hypothesis"", first postulated in the late 1980s.
According to this idea, the great reduction in childhood infections over the 20th Century had an undesirable side effect on people's immune systems, leading them to become overreactive to the slightest stimulation.
The result was thought to be the rise in asthma, hay fever and food allergies.Many scientists now dislike the term hygiene hypothesis, however, since it seemed to discourage important behaviours like hand-washing.
And they balk at the idea that infections, per se, are beneficial for children.
""It was quite problematic from a public health perspective,"" says Christopher Lowry, a professor of integrative physiology and the director of the behavioural neuroendocrinology laboratory at the University of Colorado, Boulder, US.Instead, it is the non-infectious organisms that are now thought to be key – rather than the ones that actually make our children sick.
These ""old friends"" have been around for much of our evolutionary history.
They are mostly harmless, and train the immune system to moderate its activity, rather than overreacting to any potential invader.Importantly, our bodies meet these old friends whenever we spend time in nature.
With increased urbanisation, and reduced outdoor play, many children now lack that exposure – meaning that their immune systems are more sensitive to any threat, and more likely to go into overdrive.Various studies support this idea.
People who grow up on farms are generally less likely to develop asthma, allergies, or auto-immune disorders like Crohn's disease – thanks, apparently, to their childhood exposure to a more diverse range of organisms in the rural environment that had encouraged more effective regulation of the immune system.Much of the healthy stimulation, afforded by these bugs, is thought to come through the digestive system – it is now well known that friendly microbes in the gut can improve our health in multiple ways.
But they may also act on and through our skin, according to Michele Antonelli, a doctor from Reggio Emilia, Italy, who has researched the ways that mud therapies can influence health.The outer layer of our body hosts many species of microbes, he says, and people with disorders such as atopic dermatitis (a common form of eczema) and psoriasis seem to be have an impoverished community of organisms.
The microbial diversity even seems to be linked to conditions like arthritis.
""These microorganisms can play a major role in many major chronic diseases,"" he says.A group of children enjoy a mud bath on Nepal's National Paddy Day, which marks the start of the rice planting season (Credit: Getty Images)This article is part of Family Tree, a series that explores the issues and opportunities families face today – and how they'll shape tomorrow.
You might also be interested in these stories:Climb other branches of the family tree with BBC Culture and Worklife.Healthy body, healthy mind Most surprisingly, friendly bugs from nature can even moderate the body's response to stress.When we feel vulnerable and threatened, the immune system starts raising bodily inflammation.
Since inflammation is one of the first defences against infection, this response evolved as a way of preparing the body for a potential physical injury from the threat we were facing – but it's less useful for the kinds of stresses most people face today.Remarkably, people who spent the majority of their childhoods in a rural setting tend to show a more muted response to stressful events like public speaking, with the reduced expression of inflammatory molecules like interleukin 6, compared with those who had grown up in cities.
This remained true even when the scientists controlled for other factors – such as their socio-economic status.That could have serious consequence for long-term health, since chronic bodily inflammation can contribute to a range of conditions.
It appears to increase the risk of depression, for example.
""The people who grew up in cities are kind of 'walking time bombs', in terms of their inflammation,"" says Lowry, who was a co-author on the paper.
'Dramatic effects'As results supporting the ""old friends hypothesis"" continue to role in, some researchers have started to identify the specific organisms that may be responsible these benefits, and the ways they bring about those changes.Lowry is particularly interested in Mycobacterium vaccae, which can often be found in soil.
When mice have been exposed to M. vaccae, they show enhanced activity of regulatory T cells – which, as the name suggests, help to rein in immune activity, including inflammatory responses.
This then seems to render them more resilient to stressful events, such as a potential confrontation with another, more aggressive mouse.
""We see very dramatic effects on stress resilience, even a month after the last injection,"" says Lowry.Of course, mice are not the same as human children, but it does offer some clues about the role certain microorganisms may play.Some scientists have also expressed considerable excitement about the role of ""helminths"" – soil-dwelling parasites such as roundworm – largely due to the moderated immune response they trigger in their hosts.
People who have been infected with helminths seem to have a lower risk of inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease.
Some trials have attempted to deliberately expose patients to the larvae of these parasites, with mixed successes.
These therapies would have to contend with the potential undesirable side-effects of having worms, however.
That's not to mention the obvious ""yuck factor"" that is likely to discourage many people from deliberately ingesting a helminth.More appealingly, Antonelli suggests that many spa therapies – including mud baths and thermal mineral water baths – may improve our health by introducing beneficial organisms to the skin's microbial communities.
Many species may be responsible for the benefits, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, which has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects.Making time for outdoor play can have surprising benefits, research shows (Credit: Getty Images)Forest transplants Given the importance of early exposure to friendly bacteria, many scientists are investigating the benefits of interventions that encourage greater contact with nature in childhood.
Antonelli says that the act of ""forest bathing"" – gentle meditative walks through the woods – has been shown to improve the symptoms of children and teenagers with atopic dermatitis, for example.
By touching the leaves and the soil, they may have picked up friendly organisms that enriched their skin microbiomes, he says.An ambitious project in Finland, meanwhile, attempted to bring nature to the children.
In four day-care centres, the researchers replaced the asphalt and gravel of the schoolyard with ""transplanted"" soil and vegetation taken from a boreal forest floor.
They were also given planting boxes for gardening.
""That encouraged further contact,"" says Aki Sinkkonen at the University of Helsinki, a co-author of the paper who specialises in the mud microbiome.One month later, the children showed signs of heightened microbial diversity on their skin and in their gut, as well as improved immune function.
They had greater numbers of those regulatory T cells that help to moderate the body's reactions to harmless invaders, for example.
The proportion of anti-inflammatory molecules in the blood plasma also increased – which again indicates a better regulated immune system.In the future, Sinkkonen hopes to test the long-term effects of these changes.
""I think that they should lead to lower incidence of human disease – that's our hypothesis.
""Mud kitchensGiven the known psychological benefits, many day-care centres and schools are already encouraging greater contact with nature – with outdoor lessons, regular nature walks and the construction of mud kitchens that encourage children to play in the dirt.
""In many nurseries and school, there is a growing awareness that children have fewer open spaces to play,"" says Marilisa Modena, an architect who specialises in the designs of schools, and founder of Zeroseiplanet, an Italian research and training centre focusing on the benefits of outdoor play.
""And we're looking for ways to re-introduce those activities that, until around 50 years ago, were common experiences for children.""
The greater interest in outdoor play began in Northern Europe, Modena says, but it is now spreading to many other countries.With future research, it may be possible to enrich the soil in house gardens and schoolyards with the most beneficial organisms.
For now, parents and teachers may have to work with what they have.
Mud kitchens, in particular, can be cost effective and take up little space.
All you need is an old table and some pots of pans recycled from the kitchen, and filled with a mixture of soil and water.
More sophisticated structures could be equipped with cupboards and drawers filled with stones, rocks, sand and vegetation.As the little mud chefs dirty themselves with their new imaginative creations, they may be cultivating their minds and optimising their immune systems, with potential benefits for months or even years to come.

future,"Every year, approximately 90,000 ships pass through the narrow sea lane of the Malacca Strait, which links the Indian Ocean to the Pacific.
Their cargo – grain, crude oil, and every other commodity under the Sun – comprises an estimated 40% of global trade.
Above these ships is one of the busiest air routes in the world, and below them, running along the seabed, is a dense array of submarine internet cables that keep the world online.
Together, these factors make the Malacca Strait one of the most vital arteries of the global economy.
It has been classified as a trade choke point in reports by the World Trade Organization, the US Energy Information Administration and Chatham House, the London-based foreign affairs think-tank.All of which is to say: nice strait you've got there.
Be a shame if something… happened to it.Researchers are warning that it's only a matter of time before a natural disaster like an earthquake or volcano strikes the region – and when it does, we can expect global consequences.Ship-tracking technology reveals just how many travel through the Malacca Strait (Credit: Alamy)Disruption of key trade routes is a well-established problem, due to crime or human error.
Piracy has long bedevilled the area, but the strait, cooperatively policed by Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand, is generally under control.
Still, it is not uncommon for ships to collide here: 10 American sailors died as a result of the USS John McCain running into a Liberian-flagged tanker in 2017.
But at 1.7 miles (2.7 km) at its narrowest, the strait is not slender enough to be blocked by an errant container ship in the way that the Suez Canal was by the 400m (1,312ft) Ever Given in 2021.
The greatest menaces to the Malacca Strait, which separates the Malay Peninsula from the Indonesian island of Sumatra, lie in the natural world.
Of the many intriguing maps of activity in the region, the most arresting is the one that collates the world's active volcanoes and recent earthquakes.
Along the coast of Sumatra and the more southerly part of Java, following the course of the Sunda Trench, is a band of earthquake activity, and several volcanoes.On Java, two volcanoes, Semeru and Merapi, have recently erupted.
In the Sunda Strait, which separates Java from Sumatra, is Krakatoa, and further west is Tambora, whose eruption in 1815 caused crop failure as far afield as in Europe and the eastern United States.The Tambora eruption was magnitude VEI7 in the Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI), on a logarithmic scale going up to VEI8.
An event like 1815 might occur once or twice per millennium.
But an eruption need not be of quite so high a magnitude to cause severe problems at a global choke point.You may also like:In 2018, researchers at the University of Cambridge's Centre for Risk Studies envisaged the effects of scenarios including a VEI6 eruption at Marapi.
The eruption, they suggested, might produce ash clouds and fine tephra – fragments of rock ejected into the air – that waft across the Malacca Strait towards Singapore and Malaysia.
The resultant damage to local infrastructure and supply chains, with aviation particularly badly affected, would combine with a global temperature drop of 1C to wipe an estimated $2.51tn (£2tn/€2.3tn) off global GDP over a five-year period.
That figure dwarfs the estimated $5bn (£4bn/€4.6bn) that the VEI4 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull, in Iceland, wiped from the global economy.Marapi's last VEI4 eruption was 2010.
A VEI6 eruption at Marapi is lower-probability: its return period, which is the estimated average time between eruptions, is 750 years.
Yet the stakes are high enough to merit taking the prospect seriously, says Lara Mani, a volcanologist at the University of Cambridge's Centre for the Study of Existential Risk.
And Marapi is one of several active volcanoes in the region.
VEI4, VEI5 and VEI6 eruptions, says Mani, ""can still really disrupt the strait.
And the thing is, when a volcano starts, it doesn't tell you when it's going to stop.
""If Semeru volcano in Indonesia produced a significant eruption, the disruption could be global (Credit: Alamy)Let's imagine that one of those active volcanoes – such as Semeru on Java, Indonesia – produces an eruption that would qualify as a VEI5 or VEI6.
Magma bursts from the crater.
Ash belches into the sky.
Tremors shake local towns.
If the wind is south-westerly, all air traffic in the Malacca Strait is grounded.
The ash falls onto the strait itself.
On the surface of the sea, rafts of pumice accumulate.
A large and relatively nearby earthquake would be a menace of similar scale.
It could cause a tsunami to hit the strait, as the Boxing Day tsunami did in 2004.
It would also cause turbidity currents – clouds of fast-moving, shaken-up sediment – that rip across the seabed.
""That's typically what severs cables,"" Mani says.
""In the Tonga eruption"" – Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai's VEI5 eruption in January 2022 – ""it was turbidity currents that severed the cables, causing a regional internet blackout.
The turbidity currents also bury those cables, making their recovery even harder.""
(Read more about the scale and aftermath of this eruption from BBC News: ""Tonga eruption: Atlantic seafloor felt Pacific volcano megablast"".On the upside, these natural disasters would cause less disruption to global shipping than the Ever Given did, says Tristan Smith of University College London.
Smith, a shipping expert at his university's energy institute, says that ships' machinery should be able to cope with ash and that a tsunami is more dangerous to people on land, where the wave breaks and is at its biggest, than on sea.
And presumably in the case of an eruption, an exclusion zone would be declared, forcing ships to take a different route.
The rerouting of ships would have an effect on global trade, says Smith, but the system should ultimately be able to handle it.
""If you have a ship that gets held up by three days, because it has to go the long way around Indonesia, all that ship needs to do is increase its speed by one or two knots and that delay is counteracted.
""There'd still be the matter of the grounded planes.
The eruption of Eyjafjallajökull prompted a six-day airspace ban, resulting in disruption for millions of people.
Worse, the severing of those cables would cause economic pandemonium.
""Trillions of dollars are transported through those cables every single day,"" says Mani, ""and that basically props up our financial markets.
Our submarine cables are vulnerable, and there have been accidents over the years.
""Mani highlights the breaking of several submarine internet cables by an earthquake near Taiwan in 2006, leaving a single cable connecting Hong Kong to the rest of the world.
""It took 45 days to repair the other cables, and it was very lucky that one of them managed to survive.
Imagine 45 days of nothing for Hong Kong and the broader region.
""It would have been catastrophic, she continues, not only for Hong Kong but for the rest of the world.
Hong Kong, like Singapore, is a financial hub whose effective disappearance would cause worldwide economic havoc.
""We just don't have redundancy,"" says Mani of the cables: if something goes wrong, there aren't spares to pick up the slack.
""And our satellites, in their current state, can only handle about 3% of global communication.
""Nearby Westports Malaysia is one of the world's busiest ports (Credit: Getty Images)So how can the strait be made less vulnerable?
There is nothing we can do to stop earthquakes.
The Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission and Unesco have set up early-warning systems for events such as tsunamis, and there is an existing service (the World-Wide Navigational Warning Service) that warns maritime shipping of meteorological or geological disasters.
The Japanese coast guard is the designated coordinator of the area that includes the Strait of Malacca.As for volcanoes, it might one day be possible to avert eruptions by manipulating the magma beneath them, but we are many years from that being a realistic possibility.
For now, we must get better not only at monitoring volcanoes – even a few hours' notice of an eruption makes a big difference – but at spotting them.
As Mani warns, Indonesia has ""more volcanoes than you can shake a stick at, and many of them we"" – the world's volcanologists – ""have never properly looked at.
""Elsewhere, the best preparation is diversification.
More internet satellites would help.
Local countries would also bolster their resilience by laying down new submarine cables that take a different route to the existing ones.
China seems to be taking this approach to shipping.
For years it has been trying to construct a canal across southern Thailand, obviating the need to go via the Strait of Malacca.
The Thai Canal, as it is known, would reduce energy costs by providing a shortcut for crude oil transport, but it would also add significant resilience to Chinese shipping.
Although the CCCP is thought to see this resilience in geopolitical terms, it might also turn out to be a useful insurance policy for global shipping.
Finding ways of lessening their reliance on chokepoints like the Strait, says Ben Bland, director of Chatham House's Asia-Pacific programme, is ""definitely something that's been on a lot of governments' minds in Asia"".The relevant government bodies of Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore did not respond to BBC Future's requests for comment, but we can assume that some amount of contingency planning will already be in place.
Anyone who benefits from the Strait of Malacca – and if you are reading this, you are in that category – should hope that those plans turn out to be those that are never needed.--Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called ""The Essential List"" – a handpicked selection of stories from BBC Future, Culture, Worklife, Travel and Reel delivered to your inbox every Friday.

future,"In the chilly Berlin winter of 1863, two talented American palaeontologists got talking at an otherwise unremarkable scientific meeting.
The younger of the two was a tall and handsome 23-year-old named Edward Drinker Cope, who wore his thick hair slicked sideways and talked a lot.
He had been sent to Europe by his genteel Philadelphian family to put an ocean between him and a young lady they deemed unsuitable.
The man he was talking to was Othniel Charles Marsh.
He'd been born to a poor farming family in rural New York, but had the benefit of a very rich uncle to fund his education.
At 32 years old, Marsh was reserved and a little pompous.
He wore a drooping walrus moustache and his hair was beginning to thin.Before they met, each man was enjoying the early fruits of promising careers studying fossils, geology and natural history – both were talented, ambitious and had access to family money.
After their Berlin meeting, they would go on to name a roll call of the world's most iconic dinosaurs: Stegosaurus, Triceratops, Diplodocus and enormous Pterodactyls among them.These two men were also about to embroil themselves in one of the bitterest feuds in the history of science.
What began amicably in Berlin would descend throughout their lives into all-consuming jealousy, via subterfuge, spying and sabotage.
Their warring troupes would brandish weapons at one another over the fossil-beds of the western US, and each man would pen lengthy character assassinations spilling over dozens of thirsty pages in the sensationalist press.But as 1863 drew to a close in Berlin, neither of them knew anything about all that.
They spent a few days together and toured the city before parting, exchanging addresses so they could keep in touch.You might also like:Marsh already had two degrees when they first met, and was undertaking further study at the University of Berlin courtesy of his uncle George Peabody, one of the major financiers of the 19th Century.
Cope had no degrees, though he was already accruing a slew of scientific papers to his name.Cope and Marsh had interests in common – in particular, the emerging science of palaeontology.
Strange and often very large bones apparently unrelated to living species had been cropping up all over North America for many years, and science was now catching up with them to describe the prehistoric past of the continent, and the world.Adding urgency to the study of fossils were hot debates on the new idea of evolution by natural selection.
On the Origin of Species had come out a few years previously in 1859, shifting the ground beneath Europe and America's men of science (and they were mostly men, though they were standing on the shoulders of female pioneers like Mary Anning).
Finding ancient bones that could substantiate the theory of evolution by natural selection was becoming a lively pursuit in the United States.When both Cope and Marsh went back to their respective homes in Philadelphia and New Haven, they brought a melting pot of ideas from Europe back with them.
That, and the acquaintance who would torment them for the rest of their lives.Cope's childhood diaries from when he was seven years old show his interest in expeditions and the natural world (Credit: American Museum of Natural History)At first, though, the two men appeared to get on, exchanging letters, manuscripts and fossils for several years.
Their early correspondence was friendly, though according to David Rains Wallace, author of The Bonehunters' Revenge, perhaps a little one-sided.
Cope wrote volubly, declaring his friendship and covering every square inch of the paper with his terrible handwriting.
His new friend Marsh wasn't quite so forthcoming – where Cope was ""warm but impetuous"", the general opinion of Marsh was ""glacial and unloved"".
""Marsh was taciturn,"" says Wallace.
""He was very self-directed.""
He rarely shared any more than he needed to, even with close acquaintances, preferring to publish his thoughts and discoveries in scientific journals first.
That way, there was little risk of others stealing his ideas.Their differences in character didn't appear to put either off, to begin with.
In early 1868, they went on an expedition together to Haddonfield, New Jersey, where marl beds – a mixture of clay, silt and other sediments – held many Cretaceous fossils.
Ten years before, Cope's mentor Joseph Leidy had identified one of the first dinosaur bones in the US at Haddonfield, and mentor and student had gone on to explore the fossil beds together.
With characteristic candour, the enthusiastic young Cope shared with his friend Marsh some of the area's most promising sites for fossil hunting.
Cope knew the area well, and together they discovered three new dinosaurs that season.The rich offerings of Haddonfield's fossil beds made a deeper impression on Marsh than Cope anticipated.
When Cope later returned to his old haunts alone, he was no longer able to excavate fossils for himself – Marsh had paid the site managers to pledge all the bones found in the area to him alone.
It was, perhaps, Marsh's first overt transgression of their friendship.The names of the species they dedicated to each other in the years that followed reveal growing tensions.
Cope made the first move, declaring a rather modest amphibian new to science to be called Ptyonius marshii in 1869.
Marsh responded after a while with a ""gigantic serpent"" he named Mosasaurus copeanus – however, this specimen was from one of the quarries that Cope showed Marsh, notes Sarah Shelley, a postdoctoral researcher in palaeontology at the University of Edinburgh, who has studied Cope's early mammals.
""In the same year, Cope described another specimen which he named Mosasaurus depressus,"" she says.Things only got worse from there.We may never get to the bottom of exactly who started it – Marsh (left) or Cope (right) (Credit: Alamy)Marsh may have been devious but Cope had his own flaws, which contributed to the greatest mistake of his career.It happened when remains of a large fossil skeleton were dug up from western Kansas and sent to Cope for identification.
Cope described the fossil as a species new to science, which he named Elasmosaurus platyurus.
It was a marine-dwelling reptile that lived during the Cretaceous, related to plesiosaurs, measuring around 40ft (12m) from tip to tail.
""It possesses a tail of great length, which was elevated, compressed and adapted for sculling the ponderous body through the water.
The limbs appear to have been disproportionately small,"" Cope wrote to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.
The animal's head and neck, however, posed some problems.
He noted that the loose rock and sediment around the fossil appeared to conceal some crucial details of the structure.One much larger detail, however, escaped his attention.
When he reconstructed the skeleton, his old associates Marsh and Leidy both came to see it; both had their reservations about Cope, but the 28-year-old was proving to be prodigious in his discovery of remarkable new species.The reptile's head, as his colleagues saw almost immediately, was alas on the wrong end, perched at the tip of the animal's tail.
As Cope first reconstructed it, E. platyurus had an extraordinarily long tail and a short neck.
It should have been the other way round.
""He misidentified the neck vertebrae and tail vertebrae, and vice versa,"" says David Bainbridge, palaeontologist and veterinary anatomist at the University of Cambridge.
""This was partly because the skull was found near what we now know to be the tail vertebrae.
Bones do often get jumbled up between death and fossilisation.
However, it is possible to work out 'which way round' vertebrae are.
""The first to point out the error in print was Leidy, who also used the opportunity to correct a comparable error of his own at the same time.
Cope claimed Leidy didn't bother to tell him about the paper on his mistake before it came out in print, Wallace notes.
Later on, Marsh would claim that he was the one to first point the error out to Cope – saying that Cope took it badly and became enraged.
Whether or not he lost his temper, Cope clearly felt embarrassed by his mistake.
In his later sketches of E. platyurus, the head had migrated to the other end.Cope was notoriously hasty in his academic work, publishing more than 75 papers a year at his peak – many of them short and slapdash.
But putting E. platyurus' head at the end of the tail was another level from his usual minor inexactitudes.
As historian Jane Davidson of the University of Nevada, Reno writes, ""the question was, and remains, how could Cope have made such a seemingly obvious mistake in reconstructing E.
platyurus?
""Davidson argues that Leidy, Cope's mentor, would not have been likely to wait years to point out his mentee's mistake, or to do it in print first rather than in person.
Leidy was a gentle and agreeable person (who sported a beard as bushy as Marsh's and hair as thick as Cope's) and he disapproved of Cope's war-like approach to palaeontology.
More likely, Davidson suggests, was that Leidy spoke to Cope about the error early on, but Cope was too proud to correct his mistake.
""We are dealing here with an example of Cope's well-known arrogance,"" Davidson writes.Though Leidy spotted it first, Marsh would make full use of Cope's error for the rest of his career and bring it up with relish whenever he wanted to cast doubt on his rival's competence.Elasmosaurus platyurus would have been a fearsome predator, given a head in the correct position (Credit: Alamy)Soon after their joint expedition to New Jersey, Marsh moved west to have better access to even richer fossil beds in the western badlands.
He was beginning to make a name for himself.
His uncle had funded the new Peabody Museum at Yale and, as part of the bargain, established a position for his nephew Marsh, who would be the university's first professor of palaeontology.He may have landed his position through family connections, but Marsh showed himself to not only be good at his chosen career, but to have an innate grasp of politics, newspapers, and how both could be bent to his advantage.
On one expedition in 1868, Marsh stopped off in Syracuse to take a look at a renowned discovery that had been all over the papers.
The find was the Onondaga Giant – apparently an enormous petrified man who had been dug up on a farm in Onondaga County.
After a peremptory look at the giant (who was being shown at a dime a ticket), Marsh spotted the hoax – clear tool marks in the crevices of the block of gypsum from which the man had been carved.
Marsh went back to catch his train.
He settled down to debunk the discovery, and soon his name was in papers across the country.Marsh was perhaps the first palaeontologist who knew how to feed and manipulate the public's fascination with ancient finds.
""A lot of the media excitement for palaeontology began then, especially with Marsh,"" says Wallace.
""Cope never was able to manipulate the press very well.
""Nor did Cope's hasty publishing style allow him to establish his reputation internationally to the same degree as Marsh, who published less frequently but with more care, reserving his articles for the most prestigious journals.
Cope struggled too to gain influence with funders of expeditions, so often had to pay for his work out of pocket.What Cope lacked in political and media acumen, he made up for with his powers of imagination.
He would write excited letters from his expeditions back to his wife Annie Pim Cope and, when she was older, his daughter Julia Biddle Cope.
From a dig in Kansas, he told Annie of the remarkable abundance of fossils in the landscape: ""If the explorer searches the bottoms of rainwashes and ravines, he will doubtless come upon the fragments of a tooth or jaw, and generally find a line of such pieces leading to an elevated position on the bank or bluff where lies the skeleton of some monster of the ancient sea.
""Picturing these long-dead creatures was as much a part of Cope's work as analysing their bones.
When considering giant Pterodactyls, he saw how ""these strange creatures flapped their leathery wings over the waves, and, often plunging, seized many an unsuspecting fish; or, soaring at a safe distance, viewed the sports and combats of the more powerful saurian at sea.
At night-fall, we may imagine them trooping to the shore, and suspending themselves to the cliffs by the claw-bearing fingers of their wing-limbs.
""The awe with which Cope spoke about dinosaurs could be infectious, one of his field assistants recalled.
When Cope ""began to speak of the wonderful animals of the earth, those of long ago and those of today, so absorbed did he become in his subject that he talked on as if to himself, looking straight ahead and rarely turning toward me, while I listened entranced"", the assistant wrote.As Wallace argues in his book, ""If any one American naturalist was the inspiration for the prehistoric images that have captured the 20th Century's imagination, it was Cope.
""Marsh's uncle, George Peabody, funded the creation of the grand new Peabody Museum at Yale to house palaeontological specimens (Credit: Peabody Museum)A decade after the Elasmosaurus incident, however, Cope and Marsh's rivalry was starting to absorb them more than the fossils they worked on.
Cope had lost his friendly candour when talking to fellow palaeontologists about fossil sites, and Marsh had developed an elaborate system of codenames with his allies to refer to Cope (Jones), money (ammunition), success in fossil collecting (health) and even Pterodactyl (drag).No sooner than Marsh would get a ""notice of a new and gigantic dinosaur"" to press in July 1877, describing an animal found near Golden City stretching 50-60ft (15-18m)-long and larger than any other land animal known at the time, than Cope would find a bigger one.
In August, he announced a creature that ""exceeds in its proportions any other land animal hitherto discovered, including the one found near Golden City"".
He called it Camarasaurus supremus.
""They wanted to outdo each other and name more,"" says Shelley.
""They're rushing out quite a lot of work without really taking the time to study it.
They just find a specimen and then they name it.
""The duo's haste to one-up each other led to a taxonomic tangle that would take their successors years to unpick, with many species given half a dozen different names that then had to be painstakingly pruned out of use.
""It's just a bit of a mess,"" says Shelley.The University of Cambridge's Bainbridge says modern researchers take a much more cautious approach.
In Cope and Marsh's time, after each expedition heavily laden railway trucks full of bones would haul their finds back east.
""But because they were excavating so quickly, we don't have any context about where the fossils came from, or what position they were in, or anything useful like that,"" says Bainbridge.
""One of the things that we have learned from the feud is that the speed at which you excavate fossils isn't necessarily the most important thing.
""Modern palaeontologists are ""not quite so obsessed with new fossils now as we used to be"", Bainbridge says.
""Although, of course, it is new fossils that tend to make the news.
""Marsh went fossil-hunting in the west with large contingents of students and field hands, often with a military escort (Credit: Peabody Museum)Safe to say, both Marsh and Cope were very much obsessed with naming new species.
They gathered vast quantities of fossils, many of which were extraordinary specimens that remained in sealed boxes until their deaths; owning these fossils (and ensuring their rival didn't own them) had become more important than analysing them.
Worse, Cope accused Marsh of ordering his bone hunters to smash any fossils they couldn't take back with them, to prevent Marsh's rivals – and one in particular – benefitting from any they had missed.
Marsh, of course, denied this.It wasn't just physical specimens that they fought over.
One ally of Cope's alleged that Marsh engaged in open intellectual theft at least once, attending a lecture on Permian reptiles by Cope and scurrying back to his office to write it up, holding back the Journal of Science until he could file the report as his own.
""In science, priority of discovery is secured by first publication,"" Cope's ally later wrote.
""It is in this manner that Professor Marsh has won his laurels as a scientist.
""Marsh's extensive planning, codenames and even infiltration of Cope's field expeditions with spies could not subdue his rival.
As Elizabeth Noble Shor writes in her book The Fossil Feud, Marsh was once seen in his laboratory at the Peabody bending over a specimen with a paper by Cope clutched in his hand.
""Gad!""
he exclaimed, looking between paper and fossil.
""Gad!
Gad!
Goddamnit!
I wish the Lord would take him!
""Meanwhile, in the bottom right-hand drawer of his desk, Cope was accumulating a stash of what he called his Marshiana.
""In these papers I have a full record of Marsh's errors from the very beginning,"" he confided in a friend, ""which at some future time I may be tempted to publish.
""Cope was open about how he felt about Marsh and his allies, to the extent that he named a fossil after them collectively: Anisonchus cophater.
When a friend searched Greek dictionaries to find the root of the species name, he drew a blank.
""It's no use looking up the Greek derivation of cophater, because it is not classic in origin,"" was Cope's reply.
""It is derived from the union of two English words, Cope and hater, for I have named it in honour of the number of Cope-haters that surround me.
""There was a reason Cope chose that particular creature to commemorate his enemies.
""It was a very ugly little specimen,"" says Shelley.
""There is an underlying sense of humour to it.
""Cope kept his precious store of ""Marshiana"" in the bottom-right drawer of his desk (Credit: American Museum of Natural History)Outside the realms of their squabbling, both men committed palaeontological crimes on a much larger scale.
Their most active years coincided with the intense conflicts between Native Americans and European settlers.
Many expeditions – Marsh's early work in particular – were undertaken alongside military escorts.
Cope, with fewer government connections, usually went unaccompanied.
Marsh, typically, turned to politics to establish influence, publicly supporting the Oglala Lakota leader Red Cloud (Maȟpíya Lúta).
His actions may have been guided by his desire for the fossils in Red Cloud's lands, as well as the publicity that came with weighing into public debate.
""He was not enthusiastic about Native American culture,"" says Wallace.Besides their considerable monetary value, Adrienne Mayor describes the rich significance of the fossils among Native American tribes, who told creation stories about how these creatures turned to stone, passed down for generations.As well as dispossessing Native American lands of vast quantities of fossils, both Cope and Marsh subscribed to popular racist ideas of the time that held the white male to be the pinnacle of evolution.
In one letter, Cope eagerly described robbing a Native American grave to examine the human remains in this light.
Marsh, too, would plunder graves for the same reason.Cope and Marsh were not unusual for the time.
The US, among many other countries, has a long history of fossil dispossession from indigenous lands, and while palaeontological practice today has changed in many ways, Hannah Hensel, Sandra Carlson and colleagues at the University of California, Davis, argue there is still room for improvement.Marsh's fossils demonstrating the evolution of horses was ground-breaking (Credit: Peabody Museum)Cope and Marsh's early careers were peppered with dinosaur finds, but for the majority of their lives they were more concerned with mammals – one of Marsh's most celebrated discoveries was a progression of prehistoric horse fossils showing how they evolved over time.
Their other interests were in fields such as herpetology (Cope), birds with teeth that lay between birds and reptiles (Marsh), and ancient marine reptiles (both Cope and Marsh).
It was only later on that they would make their most famous dinosaur discoveries, and even then they wouldn't be fully appreciated in their lifetimes.Many of these dinosaurs came from Como Bluff in Wyoming, between the towns of Rock River and Medicine Bow.
Both Cope and Marsh explored the windy ridge overlooking an expanse of sagebush prairie, a desolate place with brutal winds that ripped through the bone hunters' camps.
Cope and Marsh visited their field hands by rail in a luxurious Pullman car, which came complete with plush wool carpet, richly upholstered chairs and an ornate wooden dining table.
Their field assistants had to make do with starker conditions.The dinosaurs of Como Bluff were unlike anything Cope or Marsh had ever seen, unparalleled in both quantity and quality.
The dinosaurs first found here included the heavily armoured Stegosaurus and the 90ft (27m)-long Diplodocus (Marsh's finds).Cope accused Marsh of trespass on his territory, while Marsh's men flung down dirt and rocks from the bluff at rival bone hunters until they went away.The luxurious visits out west in Pullman cars couldn't last indefinitely.
The fire of their vendetta began to burn through both men's resources – Cope's first.Cope had always struggled to get government funding for his expeditions, and with the aid of Marsh's expert manipulation of people who mattered, he was eventually alienated from the scientific establishment.
Deciding to find funds elsewhere, he invested his family money in mining.
It did not go well.
He threw good money after bad for some time, until he was left destitute.
The two houses he had bought in Philadelphia (one for his family, the other for his fossils) were mortgaged, and without a regular income he began living month-to-month, trying to glean money from friends to repay his debts where he could.Not content to let his ally fade into insignificance, one of Marsh's connections tried to get Cope's fossil collection confiscated, saying it didn't rightly belong to him.
This plan didn't work, and in turn Cope called the provenance of Marsh's fossil collections into question.
Marsh's own career began to crumble when he had to resign a prestigious position at the US Geological Survey in 1892, after criticisms of the survey's lavish spending on his work.
Meanwhile, a recession was biting at the pockets of the Peabody estate, and Marsh had to mortgage his palatial house and ask Yale for a salary for the first time.As Wallace points out, it really didn't have to end that way.
If they had wanted to, they could have reconciled.
They could simply have abandoned their relentless nettling of each other and found another way to pass the time.
Cope's mild-mannered old mentor Leidy, for instance, who was reluctantly drawn into some of the feuding, quickly grew tired of it and withdrew from palaeontology altogether.
He spent the rest of his career studying microbes.Instead, caught in each other's webs, Cope and Marsh tied themselves in ever tighter knots as they grew older.
""I think they were both tremendous egomaniacs,"" says Wallace.
""And you know that goes along with the sort of tragic arc of the story.
They were great men, but they had a lot of hubris, you know, the basic element of Greek tragedy.
""The pinnacle came in 1890, towards the ends of their lives.
The newspaper editor of the New York Herald was trying to compete with the New York World, which had an exclusive publishing the dispatches of Nelly Bly as she attempted to travel around the world in less than 80 days (she did it in 72).
If it weren't for this newspaper rivalry, perhaps the New York Herald might not have amplified Cope and Marsh's own quite so garishly, devoting pages over the month of January to strings of allegations with headlines like ""Scientists wage bitter warfare"", ""Long smouldering embers of hatred"", and ""Battle of the scientific giants still being waged"".It may not have been as exciting as Bly's expedition, but it filled columns.
It also dismayed the scientific community.
Some allies rushed to Marsh's defence and some to Cope's, but many followed Leidy and simply walked away shaking their heads.Cope would picture his finds as they might have lived millions of years ago, roaming the prehistoric landscape (Credit: American Museum of Natural History)Although their feud ended up discrediting both men and embarrassing their colleagues, what seems certain is that their enmity drove both ever harder to find and name more fossils, opening up the nascent field of palaeontology for generations to come.
""Before Cope and Marsh there were just a few dinosaurs known,"" says Shelley.
""After them there were hundreds.
There's an absolute wealth of knowledge in those early descriptive papers, and some of the drawings are beautiful.
We still use them in our science now.
""More than anything, our popular view of dinosaurs has been shaped by Cope and Marsh more than any other palaeontologists.
""When I was young and just getting interested in dinosaurs, I didn't realise at the time that the core story was largely based upon the animals that these two men or people who worked for them discovered, across Montana, Wyoming, Colorado,"" says Bainbridge.
""They really discovered the classic species.
Those species have dominated certainly children's understanding of a dinosaurs from then until probably about now.
""Everybody knows where the fossils came from, but I think the actual rivalry people know little about.
""After Cope's death, one friend mused whether the vendetta was what palaeontology needed.
""Perhaps there was a scientific providence in all this; perhaps such antagonistic spirits were necessary to enliven and disseminate interest in this branch of science throughout the country,"" his ally wrote.
""This rivalry was tonic to Cope.
""Perhaps Marsh felt similarly.

future,"It's a problem humans have been reckoning with since the first moment we had more food than we could eat in one go.
When food is abundant, how do you store it to make it last?Consumers are only partly responsible for food waste.About 17% of the produce available to consumers is thrown away, though that includes food supermarkets dispose of from their shelves and food which goes into restaurant bins, as well as household waste.The remaining losses happening on farms, during processing, distribution and storage.The question has almost as many answers as there are foods.
The ancient Greeks washed figs in seawater and dried them in the hot sun, while in medieval China lemons and oranges were covered in waxes.
In 15th Century Japan, vegetables were coated with soy milk to prevent moisture loss and extend their shelf-life.
In 16th Century England, meanwhile, they were coated with lard.The problem of rotting apples and mouldering grain may have been a matter of season-to-season survival for our ancestors.
Today preventing food waste is no less of a challenge, though the stakes have changed somewhat.
The world's greenhouse gas emissions from wasted food are about 10 times greater than those from the UK.Wasted meat contributes the most to these numbers, as the energy required to produce it is typically many times greater than plant-based foods.
Throw out 100g of steak and you might have just squandered as much as the equivalent of 10kg of CO2.
By mass, however, it's fruits and vegetables that make up for the biggest pile of wasted food: roughly half a billion tonnes per year.
In the UK, oranges and mandarins are number one among wasted produce, followed by apples and tomatoes.So how can we best preserve our fruit and veg to ensure more gets to our plates?Among the tools that producers currently have to reduce food waste, many involve the use of plastics and chemicals.
A Swiss study published in 2022 showed that the climate benefits of wrapping cucumbers in plastic are almost five times higher than the negative climate impacts of the packaging itself.
Chemicals such as chlorine, hydrogen peroxide and trisodium phosphate, meanwhile, have long been used to kill various microorganisms on fresh produce to prevent spoilage and extend shelf lives.On the tree, apples have a natural wax that helps protect their skin (Credit: Alamy)Yet customers are turning away from both chemical treatments and plastics.
Chlorination may lead to formation of compounds that are suspected carcinogens, and which may either end up in drinking water (as a result of industrial processing of fruits and vegetables) or remain on the produce.When it comes to plastics, many of us feel guilty about the amounts they use.
According to David McClements, a food scientist at the University of Massachusetts, there is now a ""big push to replace plastics"" and find other ways to preserve fruits and vegetables that don't involve chemical treatments.
While many of the new technologies are still limited to research labs, others are starting to appear on supermarket shelves, or soon will.Build a barrierOne potentially promising technology is edible coating: covering fruits and vegetables in a film of protective material that can be consumed with the food.
Modern commercial coatings have come on a fair way since the early soy and lard experiments in Japan, England and elsewhere.
Coatings based on beeswax or paraffin took off in 1930s, when waxing fruits such as apples became popular.
Apples have a natural wax coating when they are picked from the tree, though this is often lost in the washing process.
Today, an artificial coating is often reapplied to apples, oranges, lemons and other fruits to help conserve moisture and extend shelf life.While these are pretty good at limiting dehydration of produce, there is still great room for improvement.
To create perfect edible coatings scientists are now experimenting with many different substances, from silk fibroin (protein secreted by silk worm) and chitosan (a sugar from the outer skeleton of shellfish), to cashew gum, fish gelatine, fenugreek protein, soy protein, cellulose and algae derivatives – the list goes on.Such coatings, applied by dipping, brushing or spraying, form a thin membrane on the surface of, say, strawberries or tomatoes, reducing transfer of gas and water vapour, limiting browning and aroma loss, and ultimately prolonging shelf life.
Ideally such coatings should keep the fruit or the vegetable well sealed, but not too sealed – otherwise you risk inducing anaerobic fermentation (that's when your apple turns into cider, for example).According to McClements, chitosan, which can be obtained as a by-product from shrimp fisheries, figures quite prominently in the current efforts to find the perfect edible coating.
In one recent study covering strawberries with chitosan and whey protein isolate (a by-product of cheesemaking), extended their shelf life by 60% if stored in fridge-like temperatures.
Tomatoes with a coating of chitosan and green algae, meanwhile, stayed close to perfect even 30 days after harvest (untreated tomatoes were in very unappealing shape after the same period).A number of companies around the world are now busy commercialising research on edible coatings.
A California-based startup called Apeel Sciences, makes edible coatings from plant oils that can double shelf life.
In the US, you can find their coatings on apples, avocados and limes; in the UK, they've partnered with Tesco to sell coated oranges and lemons – things that you still typically peel before eating, as UK and EU have strict regulations when it comes to edible coatings.
(The treatments applied to citrus fruit peel is one reason many recipes call for unwaxed fruits.
)Plastic packaging causes problems with pollution as much of it can't be recycled – but it also helps keep produce from going off, reducing food waste (Credit: Alamy)Another company, Liquidseal, sells coatings based on polyvinyl alcohols for mangoes and avocados in the UK – again, fruits with hard peels only.
However, Liquidseal has already developed an edible coating for cucumbers to replace those notorious plastic wraps, and hopes to sell it in Europe soon.Nano-treatmentAnother emerging way to boost edible coatings is to use nano-materials – materials with a particle size of less than 100 nanometres (nm) in at least one dimension (that’s 1,000 times smaller than a human hair).
""If you make the particles smaller, you can improve the functional performance of edible films and coatings, for example, by increasing their strength and barrier properties,"" McClements says.You can produce such minuscule particles by using lasers, vibrations, plant extracts or even certain microorganisms.
In one study, after a week of storage at room temperature, most regular strawberries were covered in fungus.
Among those coated with chitosan and nano-silver, however, only 10% were spoiled.
Freshly cut carrots coated with silver nanoparticles stayed fine for 70 days.
Uncoated carrots lasted a mere four.Nanoparticles are not only about edible coatings, however.
Since some of them are powerful antimicrobials, they can be added to regular plastic packaging to extend shelf life of fruits, vegetables or leafy greens.
What's more, they can be used in sensors that could inform retailers or customers that the food is no longer safe to eat, which could help avoid premature trips to the bin.
Researchers from Canada’s McMaster University, for example, developed patches that could be applied on produce packaging to predict spoilage.However, such nanoscale interventions come with safety questions.
In mice and rats, ingestion of zinc oxide nanoparticles causes liver and kidney damage.
Studies on silver nanoparticles, meanwhile, found toxicity to both model organisms such as the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans and to human cells.
""There is risk with all novel technologies, and we do have to be careful,"" says Gustav Nyström, scientist at the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology.
Nyström points out that silver and zinc nanoparticles can bioacumulate in tissues.
However, if such nanoparticles are well encapsulated within plastic packaging, he says, the risk that they would migrate into food is low.Biological defenceBacteriophages – viruses that kill bacteria – may be another potential solution to prolonging shelf life of fruits and vegetables and making them safer to eat.
An American company, Intralytix, already makes bacteriophage mixes to do just that (so far available only in US, Canada and Israel), while another company, Micreos, offers bacteriophage products for use on leafy greens as well as broccoli, carrots and other vegetables.Bacteriophages – or phages for short – kill bacteria by dissolving or attacking their cell wall, ""a bit like a needle puncturing a balloon"", says Gerrit Keizer, managing director at Micreos.
As such, phages could potentially replace or diminish the use of disinfectants while still achieving improved shelf life.
What’s more, phages are cheap, easy to apply and, above all, harmless to humans.
""You are completely covered in phages.
They are everywhere.
We are constantly consuming them,"" says Sam Nugen, food scientist at Cornell University.
Nugen predicts that in a few years, produce protected by commercial phage mixes ""won't be uncommon"" in supermarkets.
""It’s coming up,"" he says.There are many other methods under investigation for keeping fruits and vegetables fresh and safe to eat for as long as possible: plasma-activated water, ozone treatments, high-power ultrasound and bacteriocins (antimicrobial peptides or proteins produced by certain bacteria) have all been suggested.
Treating produce with pulsed light, or very strong flashes of light, can keep strawberries nice and firm for eight days in the fridge, while untreated ones will start getting mushy.
What’s more, treatments with pulsed light can increase levels of healthy phytochemicals in fruits and vegetables.Paramount to any of these emerging technologies will be proof that they are safe for customers, as well as doing the job of keeping fruit and veg good for longer.
Another challenge is scaling things from labs to real life.
""You have to apply these technologies to millions and millions of fresh fruits and vegetables, and make sure to do it uniformly, do it quickly and cheaply,"" McClements says.In the meantime, other solutions to food waste can be rather low-tech.
A study of tomato shipments in South Africa showed that a lot of loss was caused by poor road conditions: the tomatoes were simply bumped around too much in the trucks.

future,"Millions of years ago thylacines, also known as Tasmanian tigers, were widespread across Australia.
About the size of an American coyote, these dog-like creatures with stripes disappeared from the mainland around 2,000 years ago.
They remained in Tasmania until the 1920s, when they were slaughtered by European colonisers who saw them as a threat to livestock.
""It was a human-driven extinction – European settlers came to Australia and brutally obliterated this animal,"" says Andrew Pask, a geneticist at the University of Melbourne.Pask is leading a team of scientists who, together with ""de-extinction"" company Colossal Biosciences, aim to recreate the wolf-like creature and bring it back.Thanks to recent advances in genetics, namely the advent of gene editing technology Crispr-Cas9, the thylacine is not the only lost species that we could soon see again.
How does the science of de-extinction work, and what kinds of ethical questions does it raise?
You may also like:In the case of the thylacine, the first step is sequencing the extinct animal's DNA – the genetic blueprint contained in every single cell of the body.
Pask did this in 2017.
""The great thing about the thylacine, is that as it was such an important marsupial every major museum wanted one in their collection, so there are hundreds of samples around the globe, and some are exceptionally preserved,"" says Pask.Well-preserved examples of thylacine have allowed the animal's DNA to be sequenced (Credit: Sydney Morning Herald/Getty Images)""Our sample was a baby taken from its mothers' pouch.
They shot the mum and immediately dropped the baby into alcohol, which preserves DNA.
That was the miracle specimen and the holy grail for us in terms of being able to really build that genome.
""Although it's in pretty good condition, the DNA isn't completely whole.
Over time, exposure to UV light and the action of bacteria break down DNA into short fragments.
The older the sample, the smaller the fragments that are left behind, until eventually there isn't enough left (there's no chance of bringing back a dinosaur, for this reason).This leaves scientists with the seemingly impossible task of working out how the various bits of DNA fit together – a task comparable to completing an enormous jigsaw without the helpful picture on the front of the box.Luckily, a small mouse-sized marsupial called a dunnart was able to provide a blueprint.
""We found the closest living relative to the thylacine, which was the dunnart,"" says Pask.Dunnarts and thylacines share 95% of their DNA, which is thought to be highly conserved, meaning it hasn't changed much over time.
""We sequenced the dunnart's genome and compared that genetic code to our extinct species, we then overlapped them and found everywhere where it was different,"" says Pask.However, knowing an animal's DNA is simply not enough to bring it back.
The next stage of the puzzle involves tweaking the genes of the dunnart so that they match the thylacine's.
This can be done with Crispr-Cas9, the Nobel Prize-winning genome editing method.
""We start with living cells from the dunnart, and we begin to edit all of those changes, so we essentially engineer or turn that dunnart cell into a living thylacine cell with thylacine chromosomes in it,"" says Pask.Previously, gene editing wasn't advanced enough to be able to change all of the differing sequences to thylacine DNA in one go.
With millions of edits needed, it was assumed that researchers would need to prioritise the most important DNA sequences, yielding an animal genome that wasn't exactly the same as the extinct one.
Pask believes this will no longer be necessary.
""All of those technologies are in place, but nobody's done it on this scale before because the DNA-editing technology wasn't good enough or quick enough.
But now it's come such a long way that we do have that tech, and we have had significant investment to try and make this work.""
Once the researchers have a thylacine cell, they still need to turn it into a developing embryo, and then implant it into a living close-relative's womb.
If that sounds easy, then it isn't.
""We have a lot of work to do,"" says Pask.
""We've already made marsupial stem cells which took us about five years.
We're now putting those stem cells into embryos to see if we can get them to develop into a whole living animal.
""The tiny dunnart has been able to help scientists fill in the gaps of the extinct thylacine’s DNA (Credit: Auscape/Getty Images)Crispr-Cas9 was developed by the Nobel-prize winning scientists Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer A Doudna in 2012.
The technology harnesses a set of genetic scissors that are part of a defence mechanism used by bacteria.
When they encounter a potential viral threat, they copy and paste some of the attacker's DNA into their own genome to create genetic scissors that only slip that exact sequence.
Its invention has transformed the speed and cost of edting genes, allowing scientists to accurately delete sections of DNA and create cuts where they can insert new genes.It isn't just the thylacine that could be brought back this way.
Preserved scraps of woolly mammoth DNA found frozen in Arctic tundra mean that this large mammal could return.
Most woolly mammoths died out roughly 10,000 years ago.Scientists at Colossal Laboratories and Bioscience – cofounded by researchers from Harvard University – are using Crispr to splice bits of mammoth DNA into the genome of the Asian elephant, the mammoth's closest living relative.
The resulting hybrid, known as a ""mammophant'"", would be adapted to the cold Siberian tundra, and could help fill an ecological void left by the mammoth when they went extinct.
(Watch a film from BBC Reel about how mammoths might be a surprising help in tackling climate change or watch it below.
)There are, however, limitations with the technology, and obstacles that still need to be overcome.
""Many attributes that we have as living animals require several different copies of genes, but it's not easy to tell from looking at a reconstructed genome how many are needed,"" says Michael Archer, a palaeontologist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia.
""You keep your fingers crossed that one copy will be sufficient to enable the feature you're looking for, but there's a big suck-it-and-see component to these projects.""
However, genome reconstruction is not the only method scientists could use to resurrect extinct animals.The aurochs, a type of prehistoric cow, is the subject of ancient cave paintings around the globe.
It once roamed the plains of Europe and stood as tall as an elephant.
It became extinct in the 1600s.
Although long gone, auroch genes can still be found in various breeds of cattle around the continent, with descendants in Spain, Portugal, Italy and the Balkans.
Geneticists are now ""back breeding"" these species together to produce offspring closer to the qualities of an auroch.Another idea is to essentially clone the dead animal by taking the nucleus from an intact cell, and then transferring it into the egg of a close living relative in the hope that an embryo will form.The caveat is that you need a complete cell to do this, and cells quickly break down after death.
An animal like the thylacine that died out almost a hundred years ago simply couldn't be brought back this way.But it could be an option for recently extinct species.In 2003, researchers successfully cloned a Pyrenean ibex, a type of goat that went extinct when the last living individual was killed by a falling tree.
Sadly, the new-born died of a lung defect shortly after birth.Archer is currently using a variation of cloning technology to bring back the southern gastric-brooding frog, a species native to Queensland, which became extinct in 1983.
The creature had a bizarre method of reproduction, swallowing its fertilised eggs and using its stomach as a sort of womb.In 2013, he completed the first step – transferring the nucleus from a frozen frog cell into the empty egg of a closely related amphibian.
Incredibly the cells started dividing, and an embryo was formed.
""We did it many hundreds of times and it didn't work, and then suddenly one of them did and we saw this hybrid embryo start to divide under the microscope and it was very exciting,"" says Archer.After this initial excitement, however, the project stumbled when none of the embryos developed into tadpoles or frogs.
""The frog embryos developed into a ball of cells, which is normal embryonic development, but then they stopped,"" says Archer.
""Normally the outside layer of cells folds in and you get a two-layered structure which leads to a tadpole, but ours didn't do that.
""The same thing happened when the team tried to create an embryo with two living species of frogs, suggesting that it was an aspect of their experimental work that was interfering with the development of the embryo, rather than a problem with the extinct frog's DNA.
""We're working to find out what this obstacle is in living frogs before we can go back to the extinct animal's DNA,"" says Archer.The auroch was a form of prehistoric cow which roamed the plains of Europe before disappearing in the 1600s (Credit: Fine Art/Getty Images)Are we playing God?Even if we can bring back extinct animals, there are ethical considerations.Reintroducing mammoths and thylacines might upset existing ecosystems.
Since these animals became extinct, others will have evolved and adapted to fill their place.
Will these organisms suffer as a result?Thanks to climate change, the environments these creatures once lived in may have changed drastically.
Some of the plants woolly mammoths fed on are long gone as well.
Would mammoths still be able to survive on their own in the wild, and if not, who would look after them?
Would they just end up as curiosities in a zoo?
""I don't think we should bring all animals back.
I think it should have to fit certain criteria,"" says Pask.
""For the thylacine it's a recent extinction event, so its habitat in Tasmania still exists, all the food it used to eat still exists, so there's somewhere for them to go and they can thrive again in that environment.
""This animal also played a critical role in the ecosystem.
It was an apex predator so it sat right at the top of the food chain.
There are no other marsupial apex predators so when it was made extinct it left a massive gap.
""Some researchers argue that efforts to bring back long-gone species could detract from conservation efforts to save existing animals and even increase the risk of biodiversity loss, and that people may be less incentivised to stop eating meat and destroying habitats.But de-extinction technology could be used to save living species on the brink of extinction, especially those with an extremely small gene pool, like the white rhino.Black headed ferrets are one of North America's most endangered animals – every ferret alive today can trace its ancestry to just seven individuals.
Yet researchers at Santiago Zoo in Chile recently took frozen cells from a black footed ferret which died 30 years ago, and used them to create a clone, Elizabeth Ann.
Elizabeth's DNA is entirely different, so she can bring a welcome boost of genetic diversity into the population.
""De-extinction tech isn't just about bringing back the thylacine, it's about preventing other animals from becoming extinct,"" says Pask.
""We have so many bush fires in Australia, and with rising global temperatures we are going to see more adverse weather events in the decades to come.
What Australia has been doing is collecting tissues from marsupials in those areas that are most at risk and freezing them.
This means that if a bush fire came along, once the vegetation grew back you could repopulate that area with that species.
""Archer agrees that the moral rights outweigh any wrongs.
""I think it would be unethical not to do it.
I think the ethical issue here was the impropriety of humans making these animals extinct in the first place.
It's not about playing God, this is about playing smart human by undoing what we did.""

future,"They are best known for their remarkable ability to carry heavy loads and a tenacious – almost stoic – approach to toil.
In some parts of the world, the donkey has become associated, perhaps unfairly, with terms of insult or mockery.
But in a French village around 174 miles (280km) east of Paris, archaeologists have made a discovery that is helping to rewrite much of what we know about these under-appreciated beasts of burden.At the site of a Roman villa in the village of Boinville-en-Woëvre, a team unearthed the remains of several donkeys that would have dwarfed most of the species we are familiar with today.
""These were gigantic donkeys,"" says Ludovic Orlando, director of the Centre for Anthropobiology and Genomics of Toulouse, at the Purpan Medical School in Toulouse, France.
""These specimens, which were genetically linked to donkeys in Africa, were bigger than some of the horses.
""Orlando has been leading a project that sequenced the DNA from the donkey skeletons.
It was part of a much larger study to trace the origin of domestication of donkeys and their subsequent spread to other parts of the world.
The research is providing surprising insights into the history of our own species through our relationship with these versatile animals.According to Orlando, the donkeys bred at the Roman villa in Boinville-en-Woëvre measured 155cm (61in, or 15 hands – a unit for measuring horse height) from the ground to the withers (a ridge between the shoulder blades).
The average height of donkeys today is 130cm (51 inches/12 hands).
The only modern donkeys that might have come close are the American Mammoth Jacks – male donkeys that are unusually large and often used for breeding stock.Donkeys were first domesticated from wild asses around 7,000 years ago in East Africa, perhaps helping humans adapt to more arid conditions (Credit: Eric Lafforgue/Getty Images)Giant donkeys like those found at Boinville-en-Woëvre may have had an important but under-appreciated role in expanding the Roman Empire and its later attempts to hang onto its territory, says Orlando.
""Between the 2nd and 5th Century, the Romans bred them for producing mules [by cross breeding them with horses] which played a key role in transporting military equipment and goods,"" he says.
""Though they were in Europe, they were bred and mixed with donkeys coming from western Africa.
""But changes in the fortunes of the Roman Empire probably were instrumental in this giant breed of donkey disappearing too.
""If you don’t have an empire thousands of kilometres wide, you don’t need an animal that carries goods over huge distances,"" says Orlando.
""There was no economic incentive to continue producing mules.
""You might also like:To trace how donkeys have played their part through human history, an international team of 49 scientists from 37 laboratories sequenced the genomes of 31 ancient and 207 modern donkeys from all over the world.
Using genetic modelling techniques, they were able to trace changes in the donkey population over time.They found that donkeys were most likely first domesticated from wild asses – probably by pastoralists – around 7,000 years ago in Kenya and the Horn of Africa, East Africa.
While this is slightly earlier than previously believed, perhaps more surprisingly, the researchers also concluded that all modern donkeys living today appear to be descended from this single domestication event.Previous studies have suggested, however, that there may have been other attempts at domesticating donkeys in Yemen.
Interestingly, this first domestication of donkeys in eastern Africa coincided with the aridification of a once-green Sahara.
An abrupt weakening of the monsoon from around 8,200 years ago combined with increased human activity in the form of grazing and burning, led to a decrease in rainfall and the gradual spread of the desert and the Sahel region.
Domesticated donkeys may have been crucial for adapting to this increasingly harsh environment.
""We believe due to the climatic changes, the local [human] populations had to adapt,"" says Orlando.
""In donkeys, they could leverage an essential service of transporting large amounts of load over long distances and difficult landscapes.
""They noticed that the donkey population also appears to have undergone a dramatic decrease in population size after it was initially domesticated, before sharply increasing again.
""This is something typical of domestication and seen in almost every domesticated species at a point in time,"" says Evelyn Todd, a population geneticist at the Centre for Anthropobiology and Genomics of Toulouse, who was also involved in the study.
The decrease is the result of selecting a specific stock of donkeys for domestication and later breeding it purposely, which contributed to their sharp increase.
Their analysis suggests that donkeys then appear to have radiated out from East Africa, being traded northwest to Sudan and onwards into Egypt, where the remains of donkeys have been found at archaeological sites dating back up to 6,500 years ago.
Over the following 2,500 years, this new domesticated species spread throughout Europe and Asia, developing the lineages that are found today.According to archaeologist Laerke Recht at the University of Graz in Austria, donkeys made a huge difference in humanity's ability to transport goods over long distances by land due to the animals' endurance and ability to carry heavy burdens.
""While rivers such as the Euphrates and Tigris in Mesopotamia and the Nile in Egypt could be used for transport of heavy and/or bulk goods, donkeys meant a massive increase and intensification of contacts over land,"" she says.Recht says this coincided with the increasing use of bronze during in the third millennium BC.
""Donkeys could carry the heavy copper over long distances and into areas where it could not be found naturally (or only in very small amounts), including Mesopotamia,"" she says.Donkeys are still used today for some surprising tasks such as helping with street cleaning in the narrow streets of Mardin,Turkey (Credit: Ismail Duru/Getty Images)But donkeys and other equids also changed warfare during the same era.
""We started to see them in front of wheeled vehicles taking part in battles, as well as providing transport for the provisions needed for an invading army,"" says Recht.Donkeys were so highly valued that they even featured in important rituals.
""In both Egypt and Mesopotamia, donkeys were considered important enough to be buried with humans, in some cases, even with kings or rulers,"" says Recth.
""There are also examples of donkeys buried in their own right.
""She adds that in the second millennium BC donkeys were also sacrificed for so-called foundation or building deposits, and as part of a ritual associated with the signing of treaties.The oldest sample to be studied by Orlando and his colleagues were three donkeys from the bronze age in Turkey.
""They are radiocarbon dated to 4,500-years-old and have a genetic makeup similar to the modern Asian sub-populations,"" says Todd.
It suggests the Asian sub-population of the domesticated donkey split from other lineages around this time.The research also confirms that donkeys have been a far more constant companion of humans than their equine relatives, horses.
""Modern domestic horses, which were domesticated around 4,200 years ago, have had such a big impact on human history,"" says Orlando.
""Now, our study reveals the impact of donkeys extends even further.
""The animal's lasting utility sits somewhat in contrast to the amount of attention it has received compared to horses and dogs.
While today donkeys are largely overlooked in many parts of the world, in some places, however, they are still as important as they ever were.Donkeys can carry surprising loads on their backs – safely bearing 20-30% of their own bodyweight (Credit: Fadel Dawod/Getty Images)""The donkey is an important animal in the daily lives of millions of people throughout the world,"" says Todd.
""Its population is increasing by 1% each year.
Although in developed countries, donkeys aren’t used in daily lives, in many developing communities in regions including Africa and the Arabian peninsula, people still rely on donkeys for movements of people and goods.
""She adds that understanding the genetic makeup of donkeys could also help to improve their breeding and management in the future.One key question the researchers are hoping to address in future studies is to find a close relative of the domesticated donkey in the wild.
Orlando, Todd and their colleagues were able to identify three candidates.
""We know the donkey is a descendant of the African wild ass,"" says Todd.
""There are three subspecies we know about: one of them went extinct in 200AD in Roman times, the second is probably extinct in the wild, and the third is critically endangered.
""More work is needed, however, to know if there were or are other as yet unidentified sub-species of the African wild ass which would help further improve our understanding of the genetic history of the donkey and perhaps reveal more about the important role they have played in our own history.--Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called ""The Essential List"" – a handpicked selection of stories from BBC Future, Culture, Worklife, Travel and Reel delivered to your inbox every Friday.

future,"At midnight on 1 July 1982, China began a mammoth undertaking.
The goal: to find out how many people there were in the country at that exact moment in time.
No one had checked since 1964, so it was anyone's guess what they would find.
After years of preparations, armed with 29 computers purchased for the task – including at least 21 imported from the US under a special exemption – and five million trained personnel, they would spend the coming months diligently counting the members of every household in the country.By October that same year, the results were in: the New York Times ran the headline ""CHINA, POP.
1,008,175,288: ONE-FOURTH OF THE WORLD"".
Decades of growth had raised the country's population to the staggering new threshold of a billion people.
A baby was born there every two seconds.China's one-child policy was introduced in 1980, with the explicit objective of reducing population growth to zero.
But though it ran for another 36 years until 2016, it is only now that China has entered ""negative growth"" – its numbers have started shrinking for the first time in 60 years.
According to data released by China's National Bureau of Statistics, the nation was home to 1.4118 billion people in 2022, which is 850,000 fewer than there were in 2021.
It reflects a decline in the country's birth rate, which has been falling over the past six years to reach a record low of 6.77 births per 1,000 people.The change has been met with both alarm and optimism – including concerns about what this means for the global economy, and the hope that continued prosperity might not be as dependent on having a growing population as has historically been assumed.
The charity Population Matters has suggested that China's stabilising numbers should be celebrated for their potential environmental benefits and the welfare of the country's citizens.But such a stark demographic shift in the world's most populous country raises many uncertainties and implications for the future.
Is China's newly declining population really a surprise?
And how will it affect the planet?
BBC Future looks at five of the big questions to get to grips with this story.Why has it taken so long for China's population to shrink?In 1991, within just a few years of the one-child policy kicking in, China's birth rate had fallen to below replacement level.
Each woman was having fewer children than the number required to maintain the population size from one generation to the next.
In most countries, this is usually around 2.1 – one for each woman, one for her partner, and an extra 0.1 to counteract those that die as infants.China is the world's largest consumer of natural resources, such as fossil fuels, though the US has the higest use per capita (Credit: Getty Images)In the years that followed, China's continued growth wasn't because the controversial initiative had failed – it was down to a counterintuitive effect known as ""demographic momentum"".
This explains how a population with constant levels of mortality and zero migration can continue to increase for decades, even when women are having fewer than 2.1 children.It's all down to the time delay between births and deaths.
Until recently, China's population was relatively youthful, with an average age of 35 in 2010, compared to 44.3 in Germany (now it's 38.4).
At the same time, people have been living longer – in 2021, the country's life expectancy overtook that of the US.
So, though the number of babies born per woman declined drastically, there were still more babies being born than there were people dying.This has now changed, however.
It's thought that the drop in fertility rates and slight increase in reported deaths during the Covid-19 pandemic may have played a role in accelerating a decline in China's absolute numbers, though it has been long anticipated.
In this series, BBC Future takes a look at topical stories through the lens of the most pressing questions - the kind you'd need to ask to put a new development in context, or explain it to a friend.Will China's drop in numbers affect predictions for the total global population?According to the UN's World Population Prospects report for 2022, China's population was predicted to decline in 2023 – the reduction recently revealed by the country's census had been expected for some time.
In fact, the shift has only come slightly early.This milestone in China's demographics has already been factored into many projections for global population growth.
Based on the expectation that the country's population would start to shrink in 2023, along with its predictions for other countries, the UN expects that the total number of humans on the planet will continue to expand, to reach 8.5 billion by 2030, and peak at 10.4 billion by 2086.
This is the ""medium"" scenario, in which the birth rates of nations with high fertility will mellow, while those with low fertility rates will see marginal increases.India is set to become the world's most populous country this year (Credit: Getty Images)""This is happening in China now but it's not happening in the rest of the world, it won't happen on a global level for another 63 years,"" says Alistair Currie, head of campaigns and communications at Population Matters.Most of the growth will happen in sub-Saharan Africa, which is projected to contribute to more than half of the population increase between now and 2050.
The headcount in the region is projected to double in that time, with Nigeria taking the slot as the fourth most populated country on the planet.According to Shuang Chen, assistant professor in the department of social policy at the London School of Economics, focusing on China's sheer numbers would be missing the point – though she acknowledges that from this perspective, the decline might be beneficial for climate change.China was responsible for 27% of the carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere in 2022, and the country is currently building over half of the new coal-fired power plants on the planet.
""But what's really causing concerns socially is what that means in terms of the structure.
Because things are changing really fast… societies may not have time to adapt,"" says Chen.
You might also like:Which country is on track to overtake China as the most populous?In the UN's 2022 report, it also forecast that 2023 will be the year that India eclipses its neighbour and becomes the most populated country in the world.
In light of the census results, some commentators have even speculated that this may have already have happened.India's population is expected to keep going up, rising from 1.417 billion in 2022 to 1.515 billion by 2030.
This is mostly down to two factors: fertility rates have remained high, while mortality rates have gone down due to improvements in medicine.
Then there's the population's age structure.
India's population is around a decade younger than China's on average, so there are more people of childbearing age in total.How does China's fertility rate compare with those of other countries?China's fertility rate has been steadily declining since the 1990s to an all-time low of 1.28 in 2020.
For comparison, there were 2.05 births per woman in India the same year, and 1.64 in the US.
Even Japan, with its notoriously low birth rate and ageing population, had a fertility rate of 1.34.China is home to several of the most populous cities on Earth (Credit: Getty Images)The steep downwards trajectory of China's reproductive power is thought to be down to a number of factors.For one thing, there is an imbalance between men and women in China.
The one-child policy left the country with a skewed sex ratio: there was a traditional preference for boys, with many girls being aborted, abandoned or even killed.
In some age groups, there are now more than 11 men for every 10 women.
– indicating that one in every 11 men will struggle to find a partner the same age.
Other factors are thought to include the rising cost of living, and a trend towards getting married later in life.But there are also shifting values.
Survey after survey has revealed that Chinese women now view the ideal number of children as one, two, or zero, despite the introduction of a two-child policy in 2015.
These issues were compounded during the Covid-19 pandemic, when resentment about lockdowns and other restrictions led to the hashtag #wearethelastgeneration trending on social media.
Will China's population continue shrinking?Over the past 200 years or so, many industrialised countries have undergone a ""demographic transition"" – after first growing at a rapid pace, their population eventually transitions from having high birth and death rates to low birth and death rates.
China is considered to be a ""post-transitional"" society, which has already completed this cycle.However, it's less clear what will happen next.
China's fertility rates are expected to continue to decline, particularly as the population ages and there are fewer women of child-bearing age overall.
But there are two big unknowns.One is migration.
China's levels of immigration are currently extremely low, but Currie explains that this could change as the country attempts to grow its economy.
Then there's the possible impact of measures the government is taking to encourage citizens to reproduce.
At the moment, they are not proving particularly effective, but some experts are concerned that they may adopt more coercive tactics.
""For policies to reverse the fertility decline itself is very challenging,"" says Chen.
""In recent years China has already been coming up with lots of new measures, including getting rid of the one-child policy, some kinds of subsidies at different levels.
But they haven't really been working well, fertility has not reversed.
I do think this decline will continue.""

future,"In late October 2022, epidemiologists and infectious disease experts around the world began to notice an unsettling trend.As the epidemiologist Adam Kucharski explained in a Twitter thread, there was a new wave of Covid-19 afoot – but it was going largely unnoticed.
Today the alarming spikes of Covid-19 deaths and hospitalisations, which we had all become familiar with during the grim days of 2020 and 2021, have been replaced by a more insidious, but unrelenting succession of daily fatalities.As an example, let’s take a figure for 21 December 2022 – 133 Covid-19 related deaths in England according to the UK government website – a number which may sound unremarkable compared to 2020 when people were being killed in their thousands by the virus (in the same week in the US 2,919 people died from Covid-19).
But as Kucharski points out, over time even low levels of deaths can accumulate to a striking, perhaps even shocking number.In the whole of 2022, the same database reveals that 46,099 people had perished from Covid-19 in England – the government are no longer recording this data for the whole UK.
This is not quite the 75,240 deaths in 2020 or the 74,558 in 2021, but still more than most might expect.
In contrast, over the course of a particularly bad influenza season, around 30,000 people in the UK might die from flu and pneumonia.Yet within the corridors of Westminster and even newsrooms across the country, these ongoing deaths barely merit a mention compared to the myriad other crises on the agenda, from the cost of living to energy bills.
And this is not just happening in the UK – across the globe, Covid-19 has been simmering away for months.Scientists admit that it would likely take something drastic, such as the impact of a new supervariant, for this to change.
Or, as Kucharski puts it, we have become so focused on the peak of the curve when it comes to Covid-related deaths, we have overlooked how this creeping toll of fatalities can still ultimately add up to a very significant number.
""We saw this with the Delta variant in 2021,"" says Kucharski.
""It wasn't a very sharp peak but it was much, much longer and so the actual overall number of hospitalisations was quite similar to 2020.
They were just distributed over a much longer period of time because the virus wasn’t sweeping through the population in the same way,"" he says.This winter, the Northern Hemisphere has been experiencing a ""twindemic"" of Covid-19 and the flu (Credit: Getty Images)The same trend has been seen in the US, where some 2,000-3,000 Americans are still dying from Covid-19 every week.
The Harvard University epidemiologist William Hanage says that he wrote to reporters at one large media organisation in July last year, informing them that if the ongoing weekly death toll was extrapolated to a full year, it would be equivalent to three particularly devastating flu seasons.
But such news no longer automatically makes headlines.
""The numbers are actually really quite large,"" says Hanage.
""But one of the things that happens with humans is that things which are constant just become part of the everyday.
""Between January and November 2022, more than 248,000 Americans had died from the virus.
You could be forgiven for wondering how we have all become so inured to these numbers, as if such a degree of mortality is now little more than mundane.
""We've come to really pay attention when there are very large spikes,"" says Denis Nash, an epidemiologist at the City University of New York.
""That has created the situation where people now are less likely to pay attention to what's happening, unless there's something big reflected in the data.
But when you start to look at it over time, it really is scary how many deaths are still happening today.
""For Nash and others, one of the frustrations is that many of the fatalities feel highly preventable.Booster hesitancyBehind the endless graphs and visuals on government websites, it is surprisingly hard to drill down into the numbers to fully understand who is still dying from Covid-19.
While epidemiologists had all kinds of demographic information to work with in 2020 and 2021, budget cuts have meant that it is now much more difficult to answer these kinds of questions, both in the UK and on the other side of the Atlantic.For Nash, these cutbacks represent a grave public health error.
""If you really did a good job of profiling who was being hospitalised or who is dying over the last, five or six months, you could get a sense of who's falling through the cracks and why,"" he says.
""What we're talking about is not even research, but a basic function of public health that is missing at the state, local and national level.
""It's thought that China has been having a major spike in Covid-19 cases since restrictions were lifted in December (Credit: Getty Images)Instead, the narrative of these deaths can only really be pieced together by speaking to the doctors on the frontline in hospitals.
According to William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Centre in Nashville, Tennessee, they still tend to be those who were most vulnerable in the early days of the pandemic.
""The people we’re seeing hospitalised tend to be those who are either older, or younger people who are immune compromised, whether due to an illness or a medicine which suppresses their immune system,"" says Schaffner.
""It’s a lot of high risk groups.
""Andrew Ustianowski, a consultant at North Manchester General Hospital, paints a similar picture.
""The deaths I could think that I've been involved in recently have been people that have been largely very immunosuppressed or very frail, and Covid therefore has a bigger impact,"" he says.
""It also doesn't always mean that they died of Covid.
They might have caught Covid in hospital, but it was actually their underlying disease that killed them.
""Many doctors feel that one of the ongoing problems which makes these individuals even more vulnerable is the sluggish uptake of booster vaccines, even in high-risk groups.
While in the UK all over 50s and anyone younger with underlying health conditions qualify for a booster jab on the NHS this autumn – a total of 26 million eligible individuals – the latest statistics show that only half of those people have received their vaccines so far.
Booster hesitancy is even more concerning in the US, with only 29.6% of Americans over 65 receiving their latest dose.There are many reasons for this trend, from issues with vaccine access and vaccine hesitancy fostered by political tensions and misinformation, to ""Covid apathy"", with both politicians and the general public keen to move on.
In September, President Biden infamously declared that ""the pandemic is over"", while public health messaging has become diluted by other emerging issues such as monkeypox, polio and hospitals straining under the burden of a two-year backlog of postponed operations.
(Read more about monkeypox from BBC Future.
)But while missing a booster might have little impact on relatively healthy individuals who have mostly accumulated hybrid immunity from both past infections and vaccinations, evidence has repeatedly shown that vaccine-induced protection wanes rapidly in the most vulnerable.
In March 2022, one study found that immunity drops markedly among elderly care home residents after just three months.Scientists feel that governments and public health officials need to do more to ensure that the most at-risk are fully aware of the importance of ongoing jabs.
""I would argue that the ongoing cost of Covid should be less than we are tolerating,"" says Hanage.
""We could make it less, certainly in the United States, by vaccinating people better.
Society, through a combination of political inattention and pandemic fatigue, has stumbled into the current situation.
I know of people who died, unaware that they were eligible for boosters that would have likely saved their lives.
""The new Omicron variant XBB.
1.5 has been spreading rapidly in recent months, and is already widespread in the United States (Credit: Getty Images)Protecting the vulnerableBecause the ongoing impact of Covid-19 is even more disproportionally targeted towards the most vulnerable, questions are being asked as to whether society as a whole should do more to protect them, and find ways to mitigate the ongoing death toll.Emma Hodcroft, an epidemiologist at the Institute for Social and Preventive Medicine at the University of Bern, points out that Switzerland has offered the latest round of booster vaccines to all over 18s, and suggests that this strategy could be applied more widely.
""Boosting younger age groups can make a difference by cutting transmission,"" she says.
""That could protect someone in one of those vulnerable groups from getting Covid and having a really bad outcome.
""In October 2022, scientists discovered a new variant of Covid-19 circulating in New York.
It was named XBB 1.5, and it has been described as the ""great-grandchild of Omicron"".
The virus is thought to have formed when two Omicron sub-strains infected the same person and swapped some of their genes to produce even more infectious offspring.Since it was first identified, XBB 1.5's conquest has been rapid.
As of early January 2023 it has already spread to 28 countries, and outcompeted tens of other variants in the United States to become one of the most dominant, making up around 28% of cases.
So far, the virus does not seem to be any more lethal than its competitors, however scientists are concerned that it may continue to spread globally.While antivirals such as Paxlovid have been credited with reducing mortalities, their rollout hasn't gone entirely smoothly.
The UK purchased 4.98 million doses of antivirals at the end of 2021, but to date, only a small fraction have been used, while in the US, there have been questions as to whether Paxlovid has been appropriately targeted towards those who really need it.
""Doctors are sceptical as to whether every single person with Covid should be on an antiviral, which is understandable,"" says Nash.
""I think it should be just used in people who are much older – even if they've been vaccinated and boosted, they should be prioritised because of waning immunity.
Or [it should be used in] the unvaccinated and people with co-morbidities.
""There are also fears that monoclonal antibodies – lab grown proteins which supplement the body’s immune system – such as Regeneron’s Regen-Cov and Astrazeneca’s antibody cocktail Evusheld, which have been credited with saving the lives of many people with compromised immune systems, are rapidly waning in effectiveness against newer variants.As a result, Hanage says that while emerging variants such as BQ 1.1 – a subvariant of the Omicron variant – will likely have little impact at a population level, they will likely contribute to the steady ongoing death toll amongst the most vulnerable.
""It seems pretty clear that monoclonal antibody therapies for people who need them are going to be less effective,"" he says.
""And what that means is that some of the most vulnerable people are going to be more likely to struggle with infection with the viruses that we're going to see over this winter.
But because they are a minority, I think that we unfortunately tend to discount them.
""Ongoing surveillanceIn many ways the original inequities of the pandemic have only become larger the longer it has progressed.
Scientists say that there are measures we can take to try and stem the insidious ongoing deaths from the virus, but these all require a degree of societal willingness to make sacrifices, from wearing masks on public transport to break transmission chains, or improving the ventilation of buildings.Up to 90% of people in the Chinese province of Henan have recently been infected with Covid-19, according to health officials (Credit: Getty Images)""I think it is important to remember that while things are in a much better state than a couple of years ago, it isn't equal for everyone,"" says Hodcroft.
""By taking steps like increasing ventilation to keep transmission down, the easier we make it for people who are at highest risk of continuing to die from Covid.
But it can be complicated, because you have to convince whoever owns the building that this is worth doing.
""At a government level, decisions have to be made as to whether to invest large amounts of money in procuring newer versions of monoclonal antibodies which can protect a minority of citizens against the ongoing variants.Schaffner told the BBC that on the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention’s latest conference call, it was revealed that the ineffectiveness of these antibodies is already becoming a serious problem in some parts of the US.
But the bleak reality is that, once again, much of the dilemma comes down to a cost-benefit ratio.
Around 3% of the US population have compromised immune systems and scientists have estimated that it will likely cost around $200m (£164m) to produce newer antibodies, run trials and get them authorised by regulators.Epidemiologists warn that if we are too complacent about continuing to understand who is dying from the virus and why, we will likely be unprepared if the tide shifts.
Monitoring Covid-19 has never been more complex – the sheer variation in population immunity, combined with a rapid succession of ever-evolving variants, has created a situation where it is almost impossible to predict when a new wave of cases will come.
Equally, it's becoming more difficult to identify if one variant is suddenly more virulent than those that have preceded it.
This makes a degree of ongoing surveillance and data collection all the more important.
""With every few months, we are seeing that the amount of effort and money that's going into this kind of data collection is going down,"" says Hodcroft.
""The question for me always is, how do we make sure that we've got enough data so that if there is a change, we'll actually be able to see it?
And make recommendations or warnings or whatever needs to be done.
""At the same time, doctors say that while any death is tragic, there has to be a degree of pragmatism when it comes to the impact of Covid-19.
Ustianowski points out that many healthcare systems in the world ultimately have limited resources, and while the ongoing deaths from the virus are all entirely preventable if vaccines or antivirals had been administered in a timely manner, so are many deaths from heart disease or meningitis or other chronic illnesses.
""We do have interventions that can prevent people deteriorating,"" he says.
""Are we catching everybody we need to?
No not by a long way.
Is there still room for improvement with the interventions?
Yes.
But you’re never going to have a perfect situation, and that is the state of all areas in the health system.
If we intervened at the age of 30 with people smoking, we'd have less lung cancer, and we'd have less heart disease later on.
So there’s got to be a bit of realism in there as well.""

future,"When British brain surgeon Henry Marsh sat down beside his patient's bed following surgery, the bad news he was about to deliver stemmed from his own mistake.
The man had a trapped nerve in his arm that required an operation – but after making a midline incision in his neck, Marsh had drilled out the nerve on the wrong side of his spinal column.Preventable medical mistakes frequently involve wrong-sided surgery: an injection to the wrong eye, for example, or a biopsy from the wrong breast.
These ""never events"" – serious and largely preventable patient safety accidents – highlight that, while most of us learn as children how to tell left from right, not everyone gets it right.While for some people, telling left from right is as easy as telling up from down, a significant minority – around one in six people, according to a recent study – struggle with the distinction.
Even for those who believe they have no issues, distractions such as ambient noise, or having to answer unrelated questions, can get in the way of making the right choice.
""Nobody has difficulty in saying [something is] front and back, or top and bottom,"" says Ineke van der Ham, professor of neuropsychology at Leiden University in the Netherlands.
But telling left from right is different, she says.
""It's because of the symmetry, and because when you turn around, it's the other way around, and that makes it so confusing.""
Left-right discrimination is actually quite a complex process, calling upon memory, language, visual and spatial processing, and mental rotation.
In fact, researchers are only just beginning to get to the bottom of exactly what's going on in our brains when we do it – and why it's much easier for some people than others.Former US President Donald Trump was briefly flummoxed when leaders were asked to cross hands at a summit in the Philippines in 2017 (Credit: AFP/Getty Images)Around one in 10 people are left-handed, and studies on twins have shown that genetics has a role to play.
A study at the University of Oxford recently revealed four regions in human DNA that seem to play a role in determining if someone is left or right handed.Those who were left-handed were found to have ""mutations"" in four genes that code for the body's cytoskeleton – the complex scaffolding that sits within cells to help organise them.
Scans of people with these mutations showed that the white matter in their brains had a different structure.
The left and right sides of the brains of left-handed people were also better connected than in right-handed people.
""Some individuals can tell right from left innately, just can do it without thinking,"" says Gerard Gormley, a GP and clinical professor at Queen's University Belfast in Northern Ireland.
""But others have to go through a process.""
In an effort to understand what happens in wrong-sided medical errors, Gormley and his colleagues have conducted research on medical students' experience of making left-right decisions and examined the process.
""First of all, you have to orient right from left in yourself,"" he says.
When the answer doesn't come instantly, participants described various techniques, from making an L shape with their thumb and index finger, to thinking about which hand they use to write, or strum a guitar.
""For some people it's a tattoo on their body or a piercing,"" Gormley says.Then, when figuring out which side is someone else's left or right, the next step is mentally rotating yourself so you're facing in the same direction as the other person.
""If I'm facing you, my left hand will be opposite your right hand,"" says Gormley.
""That idea of mentally rotating an object adds an extra degree of complexity.""
Other research shows that people tend to find it easier to judge if an image shows a left or right hand by imagining their own hand or body rotating.Research published by Van der Ham and her colleagues in 2020 found that around 15% of people rate themselves as insufficient when it comes to identifying left and right.
Almost half of the four hundred participants in the study said they used a hand-related strategy to identify which is which.The researchers used something called the Bergen right-left discrimination test to dig deeper into how these strategies work.
Participants looked at pictures of stick people either facing toward or away from them, with their arms in various positions, and had to identify their highlighted hand as their left or right.
""It seems simple, but it's kind of frustrating if you have to do a hundred of these as quickly as you can,"" says Van der Ham.In the first experiment, the participants sat with their hands on a table in front of them.
""There was a very clear effect from how this little stick figure was positioned,"" says Van der Ham.
""If you were looking at the back of the head, so it was aligned with you, people were a lot faster and more accurate.""
Similarly, when the stick person was facing the participant but had their hands crossed, so their left hand was on the same side as the participant's left hand, people tended to do better.
""That tells us that the body really is involved in this,"" says Van der Ham.
The next question was whether participants were using cues from their body at the time of the test to identify left and right, or referring to a stored idea of their body instead.To answer that, the researchers repeated their experiment, but this time tested four different scenarios: participants sat with their hands either crossed or uncrossed on the table in front of them, and had their hands either visible during the test, or covered with a black cloth.But the researchers found that none of those changes influenced test performance.
In other words, participants didn't need to actually see their hands in order to use their own body to distinguish right from left.
""We haven't completely solved the issue,"" says Van der Ham.
""But we were able to identify our bodies as being a key element in identifying left from right, and that we consult our body representation as we have it in a more static way.
""Mistakes made during medical procedures due to left-right errors have led some surgeons to take extra steps to ensure they operate in the right place (Credit: Tommy London/Alamy)In Van der Ham's experiments, the boost in performance that came from being in line with the stick person was more pronounced in people who said they use a hand-related strategy to tell left from right in their daily lives, as well as in women generally.
The researchers also found that men tended to be faster in responding than women, but the data did not back up previous research showing that men perform better overall in left-right discrimination tests.You might also like:Exactly why people differ in their ability to tell left from right isn't clear, though research suggests that the more asymmetrical someone's body is (in terms of writing hand preference, for example) the easier they find it to tell left and right apart.
""If one side of your brain is slightly larger than the other, you tend to have a better right-left discrimination,"" says Gormely.But it could also be something that we learn in childhood, like other aspects of spatial cognition, says Van der Ham.
""If kids are in charge of finding the way around, if you just let them walk in front of you for a couple of metres and make the decisions, those are the kids that ended up being better navigators,"" she says.Research by Alice Gomez and colleagues at the Lyon Neuroscience Research Center in France hints that left-right discrimination is something that children can pick up quickly.
Gomez designed a two-week intervention programme, delivered by teachers, designed to increase five-to-seven-year-olds' body representation and motor skills.When they were tested on their ability to locate the correct body part on themselves or a partner – their right knee, for example – after the programme, the number of left-right discrimination errors were almost halved.
""It was very easy for us to increase the abilities of children to be able to locate the [body part] on the basis of the name,"" says Gomez.One reason for this might be that the children were taught a strategy – to think about their writing hand – for when they couldn't remember right and left.
The programme's focus on children's own bodies is another possible explanation, especially as other research shows that an egocentric reference frame is key when we make left-right decisions.In a typical classroom, children might label body parts on a diagram rather than their own bodies, because the latter is more time-consuming and difficult to assess for a teacher, says Gomez.
""It's very rare that they will have the time to be egocentric,"" she says.Most of us can distinguish up and down intuitively, but working out left from right can take more mental gymnastics (Credit: Alamy)While there are plenty of everyday scenarios where knowing left from right is important, there are some situations where it's absolutely critical.
Brain surgeon Marsh was able to put right his wrong-sided trapped nerve surgery – but a surgeon removing the wrong kidney or amputating the wrong limb, for example, would have devastating consequences.Medicine is not the only field where left-right errors can make the difference between life and death: it's possible that a steersman turning the ship right instead of left was a contributing factor in the sinking of the Titanic.But while some people have to put in more effort to judge left and right, everybody has the ability to get left-right decisions wrong, says Gormley.
He hopes that more awareness of how easy it is to make such a mistake will lead to less stigma for those who need to double check their decision.
""As health care professionals, we spend a lot of time labelling spatial orientations: proximal, distal, superior, inferior, but really pay no attention to right or left,"" he says.
""But actually, of all the spatial orientations, that is the most challenging.""

future,"It is the ""smell of decay and death"", says Beth Stauffer, from the University of Louisiana.
""It has a physical presence.
This layer of very striking greens and blueish greens…when you put your paddle in it, you can feel it.
""She's describing the harmful algal blooms (HABs) that used to be more associated with marine environments.
But in recent years they've been moving further inland and affecting freshwater systems, too.
And scientists such as Stauffer are trying to find out why.HABs occur when certain kinds of algae grow very quickly due to increased nutrients in the water – typically when artificial nitrogen and phosphorus applied to farmers' fields wash out in the rain and enter waterways.
The algae receive a meal on a scale they would never get naturally, and a bloom is formed.
Sometimes this is harmless.
But at scale, many types of algae can turn toxic and harmful to humans and animals.
And this scale can be extraordinary.The explosive growth of algal blooms is linked to rising temperatures and rising pollution.
These green waves are both a warning sign and a symptom of a changing climate.
As farming fertiliser and a tsunami of human sewage hit our warming waterways, we are in danger of turning our very drinking water toxic.In the ocean, a coastwide bloom of Pseudo-nitzschia algae in spring 2015 resulted in an outbreak of the neurotoxin, domoic acid, along the entire US west coast, spanning four states.
Elevated toxins were found in marine mammals and fisheries, with over 1,950kg (4,300lb) of clams lost in just one day and over 200 sea lions stranded with neurotoxin poisoning.
A bloom in the Gulf of Mexico in 2017 was recorded to cover 8,776 sq miles (22,720 sq km).Typically these giant blooms occur near deltas, where rivers – draining huge areas of land and fertiliser – meet the sea.
But inland rivers and lakes are increasingly getting swamped before they even reach the sea.
And their waters endanger the human populations that border them.
People and animals exposed to algal toxins by drinking or swimming can suffer rashes, fevers, even liver and kidney damage.Farming fertiliser and sewage pollution is turning drinking water toxic (Credit: Yuliia Zozulia / Getty Images)According to an overview of HABs by the binational United States and Canada Great Lakes organisation The International Joint Commission, only 12 published accounts of algal outbreaks were recorded in Canada and the US in the 1980s and just 19 in the 1990s.
By the mid-2000s, however, reports of HABs suddenly began appearing in unlikely landlocked states.
By 2021, nearly 1,700 HAB-related warnings and public health advisories were issued within the US alone.
HABs are now a major environmental problem in all 50 states.These toxins may also be entering the food chain.
In August 2022, over 60 California sea lions showing signs of domoic acid intoxication – including seizures, disorientation and loss of muscle control – had to be saved following an HAB incident.
Stauffer confirms that this now occurs annually on the western and eastern coasts of the US.
""Sea lions aren't feeding on little microscopic [organisms], they're feeding on fish, on crustaceans,"" she says, just like we do.
Sea lions commonly feed on fish such as anchovies.
During the 2015 incident, anchovies caught in fishing nets were found to have very high levels neurotoxins from the algal blooms.This is far from a US-only problem.
Jessica Richardson, a researcher at the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, Lancaster Environment Centre in the UK, has described blooms of cyanobacteria as a ""threat to global water security"" that is expected to increase due to a chemical and climate cocktail of ""nutrient enrichment, increasing temperature and extreme precipitation in combination with prolonged drought"".
In short, more sewage and fertiliser being flushed into warmer waters by heavy rain hitting parched ground.As in the US, bay areas in China such as Zhanjiang Bay rarely saw HABs before the 1980s but have occurred “periodically and frequently” since the 2000s.
Norwegian fish farms were devastated by a toxic algal bloom in 2019 that killed millions of salmon.
In Scotland, HABs were relatively unheard of until 2013 when a large bloom off the Shetland Islands saw 70 people report shellfish toxicity symptoms, with the number affected believed to be substantially higher.
HABs now result in the loss of 15% of turnover to the Scottish shellfish industry annually.England's largest and most famous lake, Windermere, has also started turning a troubling shade of blueish-green.
In August, local campaigner Matt Staniek went viral with a short video scooping green gunk from the lake's surface, stating ""I got a cyanobacteria bloom tested as I felt this wasn't being taken seriously enough.
It exceeded World Health Organization guidelines… Windermere is not safe.
""From the microplastics sprayed on farmland to the noxious odours released by sewage plants and the noise harming marine life, pollutants are seeping into every aspect of our existence.
Sensory Overload explores the impact of pollution on all our senses and the long-term harm it is inflicting on humans and the natural world.
Read some of the other stories from the series here:Staniek, a 20-something zoologist who grew up in Windermere village, says that algal blooms would appear occasionally when he was a child, but ""it has been getting progressively worse"", noting that the annual average temperature of the lake has increased by 1.7C (3F) in the last 50 years"".
He describes the explosion of blooms as ""the sign of a dying lake"".Unlike in the US, however, Staniek believes the nutrient loads feeding the blooms aren't coming primarily from pesticides, but from local sewage plants.
In 2021, the United Utilities Staveley sewage works, near Windermere, spilled untreated sewage into a nearby stream 80 times for a total of 1,172 hours, according to an interactive map by The Rivers Trust which documents sewage spills.
This was not a one off; the United Utilities plant at Grasmere spilled 90 times for a total of 1,348 hours.
The UK’s ageing sewage network is struggling to cope with intense rainfall, a growing population and an historic lack of investment.
The map reveals that the whole of England and Wales is in a similar, sorry, sewage-drenched state.
Other water bodies, such as the River Wye – also a tourist hotspot – are ""facing ecological disaster"" due to once unheard of, but now annual, algal blooms, blocking out the sunlight and killing everything below.Harmful algal blooms are a major environmental problem in all 50 US states (Credit: Alamy)The Windermere algal bloom peaked this summer on 13 August, photographed by satellite covering half the lake and reaching from bank to bank.
""A video taken from 14 [August], which I put up on social media, shows a little girl swimming in amongst this blue-green algae.
It's such an incredible threat,"" says Staniek, adding that several people have contacted him to say they became ill, mostly with vomiting and diarrhoea, after swimming in the water.Great Lakes, great bloomsThe blooms on the American Great Lake, Lake Erie, however, are arguably the world's worst, known to cover an area the size of New York City.
In 2014, a major HAB on Lake Erie, the world's 11th largest freshwater lake, prompted the city of Toledo, Ohio, to issue a ""do not drink"" order for tap water that affected nearly 500,000 people for three days.
Residents couldn't even use the water to brush their teeth.
More than 100 fell sick, becoming the country's first recorded drinking water–associated public health outbreak caused by harmful algal blooms.Richard Stumpf leads The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s harmful algal blooms research team and has worked on the Great Lakes for over 15 years.
The first bloom he saw on Lake Erie in the 1990s was believed to be ""an anomaly"".
The subsequent 2003 bloom on Lake Erie was the first ""really large, noticeable one,"" he says.
Since then, NOAA's Great Lakes lab has recorded HABs getting bigger ever year (except for 2022 due to historically low rainfall causing less runoff from fields).
""When the wind stops, it's gross,"" he says.
""There's no other way to describe it.
You get this layer of what looks like thick, green paint on the surface.""
In the thickest blooms, he's heard charter boat captains say their engines have trouble turning the propellers due to the density of algae.
The smell of sulphur and decay, especially if the bloom becomes trapped in enclosed marinas, can become ""overpowering"".You might also like:Cyanobacteria start blooming in Lake Erie when water temperatures rise above 20C (68F).
In the mid-2000s, this only happened in the peak summer months, July and August.
But now, says Stumpf, the cyanobacteria season begins from early May and can last till November, due to global warming.The great US HABs are therefore caused by a perfect storm of warmer temperatures, fertiliser use, and an increase in heavy rainfall events which flushes the fertiliser out and into waterways.
The intensive use of commercial fertiliser in the US was 46.2lb per acre per year in 1960; by the year 2004 this was up to 146lb, an increase of 215%.
While a recent study by Northwestern University finds that rainfall, especially in the Eastern US, has intensified in the first two decades of the 21st Century, with researchers explaining: ""What we found is pretty simple: When it rains now, it rains more.
""A BBC report found that the seven main water companies in England and Wales discharged untreated sewage into rivers and the sea more than 3,000 times between 2017 and 2021.
""Why is that happening?""
asks Staniek.
The longer this goes on, he points out, the more phosphorus is stored up in the sediment of lakes like Windermere.
A petition to name Windermere a Special Area of Conservation with a legal mandate to reduce nutrient levels now has over 150,000 signatures.At a national scale, the chair of the Environmental Audit Committee, a cross party parliamentary group, has said that water companies have turned ""a blind eye"" to unpermitted sewage discharges, and urged both regulators and water companies to ""get a grip"".In 2014, a major algal bloom on Lake Erie prompted the city of Toledo, Ohio, to order residents to avoid drinking tap water for three days (Credit: Ty Wright / Getty Images)There is work that can be done with communities, farmers and landowners, too.
Staniek has set up the Windermere Lake Recovery CIC (Community Interest Company) to advise on nature-based solutions and river restoration.
Floodplains in particular are crucial to both filter nutrients and recharge groundwater aquifers – natural services that we now desperately need.
Staniek is working with a local landowner to re-naturalise a river, adding sediment traps and nutrient traps, ""which will then hold water back after peak flood events and allow it to be absorbed and not just flow directly into Windermere,"" says Staniek.
He's also planting a riparian ""buffer"" strip of trees, soft brush and reeds to ""absorb the phosphorus that can potentially come off that landscape"".The US Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental non-profit, is calling for a wider adoption of such practices, partnering with states to financially reward farmers who plant cover crops, properly apply compost and manure, and follow fertiliser best practices, including regular soil testing and using fewer chemicals.There are also lessons for city-dwellers.
The single largest irrigated crop grown in the US is ""lawn"", much of which is treated using chemical fertilisers: by ditching the gardening chemicals, installing green roofs, planting trees, and growing gardens or parks with rain-absorbing plants, urban residents can capture rainwater before it collects urban pollutants such as lawn fertiliser and flows into waterways.On a grander scale, municipal canals and reservoirs can even be shielded from the sun using floating solar panels: helping to produce clean energy, reduce water loss, and prevent algal blooms (which need sunlight in order to form).
(Read more about the floating solar panels that track the Sun).
""There will always be some of these blooms,"" says Stumpf.
""The world is getting warmer which means that blooms may last longer.""
But, he says, it ultimately comes down to the pollution and nutrients we release into the water.
It's the choices we make as to ""how we use the land"", he says.

travel,"It was a bright day in December 2021 and snow was lightly falling over Mādahòki Farm, an Indigenous visitor attraction and event space just outside Ottawa, Canada.
I was at the Pibón (winter) festival, and the Anishinaabe artist Rhonda Snow stepped on a small stage that still seemed to tremble from the exuberant footsteps of just-departed pow wow dancers.
Nationally renowned for her vivid Woodlands-style paintings, Snow was here to talk about her lifelong work preserving the endangered Ojibwe spirit horse; the breed, also known as the Lac La Croix Indian pony, is the only known indigenous horse breed in Canada.Snow explained that she was a young girl living in north-western Ontario when she overheard some elders talking about these small, hardy horses that lived free in the boreal forest.
She was captivated.
""I thought to myself, someday I'm going to find them,"" she said.She travelled around Indigenous communities and heard many stories of Indigenous peoples' reciprocal relationship with the Ojibwe spirit horse, seeing the animals as guides and teachers.
Such as the Métis fishermen who partnered with the horses each winter to haul fish off frozen lakes – although the horses were never domesticated back then, they would use their hooves to create ice fishing holes in return for food and shelter from the fishermen.
But, having been culled to near-extinction by European settlers who considered the wild animals a nuisance, the horses themselves were few and far between.Rhonda Snow's artwork is on display at Mādahòkì Farm (Credit: Karen Gardiner)That the breed has survived is due to an event Snow depicts in her painting titled The Heist Across the Ice by the Light of the Moon.
It's a story that could have been written in Hollywood.In 1977, only four mares remained on an island in Lac La Croix, north-western Ontario.
Having deemed the wild animals a health risk, Canadian health officials made plans to slaughter them.
But, before they could do so, four Ojibwe men staged a daring rescue.
They rounded up the mares, put them on a trailer and spirited them across the frozen lake and over the border to Minnesota, where they were bred with a Spanish Mustang.
Careful management and selective breeding has since revived the Ojibwe spirit horse, which now numbers around 180 and is back in Canada.The stories Snow heard of the Ojibwe spirit horse's long and close relationship with Indigenous people counter the commonly accepted history of horses in North America.
That story goes that horses once ran freely across the continent before going extinct during the last ice age thousands of years ago, and that they remained absent until Europeans arrived.
According to Indigenous oral histories and spiritual beliefs, however, horses have always been on the continent they know as Turtle Island, and recent research backs them up.The Ojibwe spirit horse is the only known indigenous horse breed in Canada (Credit: Karen Gardiner)The Spanish did bring horses to what is now Mexico in 1519, but research by Dr Yvette Running Horse Collin cites written Spanish accounts that place herds in what is now Georgia and the Carolinas in 1521.
Proof, she argues, that horses were here before the Europeans: as Collin notes, it would have been impossible for those Spanish horses to have multiplied and travelled so far in just two years.
When it comes to the Ojibwe spirit horse, according to the Ojibwe Horse Society, DNA testing shows they are a separate breed from the horses introduced to North America by Europeans.When I returned to Mādahòki Farm in November 2022, I saw more evidence that Ojibwe spirit horses have long walked this land.
Cultural ambassador Maggie Downer, who is Mohawk, introduced me to the farm's herd – there are no wild herds left – who were fuzzy in their winter coats and clearly built for harsh, northern environments.
They had compact, powerful bodies, thick manes, small, hairy ears and extra nose flaps to protect them from the cold.Mukaday-Wagoosh (Black Fox in Ojibwe), Gwiingwiishi (Grey Jay) and Migzi (Eagle) came rushing over and pushed their muzzles through the fence to be petted.
Downer pointed to two-year-old Migzi's distinctively Ojibwe markings – the tiger stripes on his legs and well-pronounced dorsal stripe running down his spine – that the farm hopes will make a prized stud out of him.As an ambassador, Downer says her job is to connect with the Indigenous community and the non-Indigenous community alike ""to [promote] awareness around Indigenous cultures and that we're still here"".The horses are ""four-legged ambassadors"", she said.
""This breed faced a lot of the [same] challenges that we did as Indigenous people.
They faced eradication.
But horses are so resilient and have so much to teach us.
""The horses are incorporated into the farm's cultural sharing and education programmes (Credit: Karen Gardiner)The horses are an attraction, but also represent the farm's broader work to reclaim and celebrate Indigenous culture.
""Our histories are just so similar,"" Downer said.
As a young Indigenous woman, she sees a symmetry in reclaiming what was lost.
""Because it was outlawed by the Canadian government, our young people don't know their histories.
It's the same with these horses.
There's that connection between us.
""In the farm's event space, which was set up to welcome a class participating in one of its Indigenous culture school programmes, Trina Mather-Simard, founder of Indigenous Experiences, which operates the farm, told me that the idea to establish the farm was sparked when she heard Rhonda Snow on a podcast about Ojibwe spirit horses in 2020.
""I was just so inspired,"" she said.
""My daughters are long-time equestrians; we've had horses for years.
I'm Ojibwe myself and I just couldn't believe I had never heard of [them].
""""I saw a lot of [similarities] to our own story,"" she continued, ""in a way that we can share easily, about their connection to the land, the displacement and the resilience: that they went down to only four of them and yet they're still here.
""Cultural ambassador Maggie Downer sees the horses as ""four-legged ambassadors"" (Credit: Karen Gardiner)Mather-Simard and her daughters bought four horses from a farm in Alberta and looked for someplace to keep them.
At the same time, Indigenous Experiences was searching for a permanent venue as it had been operating from a temporary space outside the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, Quebec, just across the river from Ottawa.
In the 164-acre farm, the company found the perfect solution: with so much land, they could incorporate the horses into their cultural sharing and expand to offer land-based education.And the horses have plenty to teach, said Mather-Simard.
""Similar to the [traditional Indigenous culture of giving] thanks for the animals that would give their life to provide food and what was needed for survival,"" she said, ""our community viewed our relationship with the horses as a reciprocal relationship: where our ancestors provided food and protection in harsh winters and the ponies helped the community to survive, [by helping with] ice fishing or helping to transport goods and people.""
Because the Ojibwe regard the horses as kindred spirits – ""as equals that are giving back,"" she added – they call themselves ""caretakers"" of the horses, rather than owners.As well as welcoming visitors to meet the horses, the farm hosts a series of free festivals celebrating the seasons (Credit: Mādahòkì Farm)Since opening in late 2021, the farm's herd has grown to nine – the most recent addition is a foal named Giizhik (Cedar), born in a snowstorm in April to Wishkossiwika (Sweetgrass).
As well as welcoming visitors to meet the horses and visit its market stocked with Indigenous-made art and crafts, the farm hosts a series of free festivals celebrating the seasons.When I attended the winter festival, I watched Inuit throat singers, feasted on bison stew and bannock (the bread associated with the Indigenous people of Canada), then walked through the forest along the farm's Legacy Trail, which was lined with interpretive signage describing traditional medicinal uses of the plants growing there.
Other cultural offerings have included Haudenosaunee corn husk doll-making, a painting class led by Snow and dreamcatcher and moccasin workshops.The farm sits on traditional Algonquin territory, but it is intentionally inclusive of many different Indigenous cultures.
""Because we're in the nation's capital, we're able to, in a small way, introduce that diversity,"" said Mather-Simard, referring to the fact that Canada is home to hundreds of First Nations as well as Inuit and Métis people.The farm also operates a culinary training programme, which teaches youth about traditional food production; has an equine assisted learning scheme, which is led by Downer and incorporates the spirit horses; and runs arts and crafts workshops and business development classes for Indigenous artisans.I asked Mather-Simard about future plans for the farm and she took a deep breath before reeling off a list of ambitious projects, including the arrival of bison to provide traditional food and new forest trails for the spirit horses that more closely resemble their traditional wild habitats.
""Reconciliation rocks"" are placed around the farm's Legacy Trail (Credit: Karen Gardiner)I thought about how close these horses came to disappearing and was touched by the thought of being able to watch them grow and thrive over the coming years.
Through sharing Indigenous perspectives, Mather-Simard hopes that Mādahòkì (which means ""sharing the land"" in Anishnaabe) can serve both as a space where Indigenous communities can reconnect with the land and a site of reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people.Tourism has ""really shifted in the last few years as people are searching out their path of reconciliation"", she said.
""Our industry likes to say that Indigenous tourism is really reconciliation in action because it gives you a tangible way to connect with the community and learn.
""At the centre of it all are the Ojibwe spirit horses, themselves living representations of reconciliation.
The horses are teachers, said Downer.
""They instinctively have compassion for each other in their herd.
We need to start translating [their teachings] into our society, as a blended community of Indigenous and non-Indigenous people.""

travel,"Cautiously reversing, an unhealthy grinding sound came from my vehicle as its four-wheel drive fought for traction.
I was on sheer ice.
The main roads and towns were blissfully clear, but turning off onto jagged moorland tracks for the final 30 minutes of my drive, the conditions worsened mile by mile.
These are the joys of visiting Tan Hill Inn in December.
Tan Hill Inn is isolated in the middle of the Yorkshire Dales, a desolate expanse of moors, valleys and hills in northern England.
When William the Conqueror's surveyors ventured here in 1085, they promptly left after jotting down a single word to describe the surrounding area's setting: ""wasteland"".As the highest pub in Britain (located 1,732ft above sea level), the weathered, 17th-Century stone structure has long attracted locals and hardy wanderers, but its remote setting means visiting is not for the fainthearted.
However, those who make the journey are rewarded with a cosy bar next to a roaring hearth, traditional British treats like giant Yorkshire puddings and guest rooms upstairs, should they choose to settle in for the night.
With a whiteout on the horizon as I approached, as well as sheet ice underfoot and bleak moorland as far as I could see, some rural hospitality was much needed.The area surrounding the Tan Hill Inn was once called a ""wasteland"" by William the Conqueror's men (Credit: Eibhlis Gale-Coleman)How the inn has managed to survive for hundreds of years in such harsh conditions is mind-boggling.
Tan Hill is regularly battered by ice storms, snow drifts and high winds.
Survival became even more difficult after the 2022 British energy crisis when the inn saw its electricity bills rise by £100,000.
Yet something about it still draws thousands of ambitious cyclists, hikers, sightseers, road-trippers and stargazers each year – Tan Hill's high elevation and lack of light pollution mean the inn is one of the few places in England occasionally graced by the Northern Lights.The area surrounding Tan Hill has always been on the edge of British history.
Its name comes from the Celtic phrase ""Tan Heol"" (Hill of Fire), and from the 6th Century, Celts would meet here for fires, rituals and sacrifices.
Tan Hill was also narrowly bypassed by a Roman road, and nearby at the parish of Stainmore, a legendary battle took place between the Viking Eric Bloodaxe and the Earl of the Kingdom of Northumbria.
There is local folklore, too, including rumours that Mary Queen of Scots and 18th-Century highwayman Dick Turpin paid visits.Yet, I'd be surprised if any of these historical visitors ventured to Tan Hill in the winter.
""I've only seen a gritter [a vehicle that spreads grit on roads in icy weather] on that road twice in my life,"" the bartender, Hayley, laughed as I stepped inside.
The bar was a flurry of kitschy memorabilia and felt like a Yorkshire version of a Route 66 saloon.
Draft beers were pulled from gleaming gold tap handles, beer mats were pinned like stickers across the exposed ceiling beams, and a stand filled with calendars of the inn for sale stood next to the bar.
I played it safe and ordered a cappuccino.
Navigating those moorland tracks home would require a clear head.
In nicer weather, the inn attracts hikers, road trippers and star-gazers (Credit: Mark Dunn/Alamy)I took a stool by the fire, and a fellow visitor cheerily called to me from across the room, asking if I'd seen a blue van along the road leading up to the inn.
When I replied yes, her face lit up, and she sighed with relief: ""Good, it's still there"".
She had fallen victim to a nasty curve in the road just before a steep hill, and the van couldn't build enough acceleration to get over the ice.
The two women and their children were stranded – quite happily so – and planning to reattempt the journey and return to the main road.
After an English breakfast, of course.
Hayley reappeared with the cappuccino and invited me to look around the inn.
She led me through the low, wood-beamed ceiling and stone-floored rooms and out the back into a converted barn with strobe lights and a stage for concerts.
Before opening the adjoining door, she pointed to an igloo-like transparent dome outside – ""our stargazing pod, beautiful in summer"".
It would arguably be even more exciting in winter under the Northern Lights, if you could brave the cold.
The pod was designed as a bedroom where guests could fall asleep under the stars.
However, for now at least, the transparent dome is available for stargazing dining experiences.
Inside, a table is topped with a fancy white cloth, and guests are served meals under some of the darkest skies in the UK.
The polycarbonate material is transparent for optimal stargazing, yet over 200 times stronger than glass – a necessary precaution considering Tan Hill's extreme weather.Those wanting to spot the Northern Lights will need to monitor the Northern Lights forecast and apps.
November to February is the prime ""Northern Lights season"".
The Dark Skies Festival (held 10-26 February this year) runs annual events with telescopes across the surrounding Yorkshire Dales National Park, and hosts an event at Tan Hill Inn most years.
It is worth pencilling in, especially since 2022 saw the park designated as an International Dark Sky Reserve.The surrounding Yorkshire Dales National Park was recently designated as an International Dark Sky Reserve (Credit: Stephen Dinsdale/Alamy)To spot the Northern Lights, you'll need clear skies, but in recent years Tan Hill has made headlines for its exceptionally snowy skies.
In November 2021, 3ft of snow fell outside the Tan Hill Inn during Storm Arwen and left those enjoying an Oasis tribute act stranded for three days.
The story made national news, and a reunion of the snowed-in guests is planned for this year.
The inn is adept at handling such disasters, and stranded staff members and guests simply stay overnight in the inn's guestrooms upstairs.
However, it does create some logistical and staffing issues, and the team must think fast and creatively to cope in difficult weather.
On one such night, Hayley did.
""I said my husband has bar experience – [just] not here,"" she laughed, ""but bar experience all the same.
We ran the barn together for over 100 people attending a tribute act night.
""Understaffing is all too familiar in hospitality, especially with rising living costs narrowing profit margins.
Tan Hill Inn experiences these issues much more acutely, with harsher conditions, colder rooms to heat and the underlying worry that staff won't manage their commute.
When I showed up, Hayley's teenage daughter was helping work the tables after another employee couldn't make it in.According to the Tan Hill Inn's manager, Nicola, running such a remote pub requires strict organisation.
Case in point: the pub relies on diesel deliveries for electricity.
""As long as we order on time, we don't have any issues,"" she said.
""The owner has upgraded the system, and he is able to check online how much is left in the tank.
""The inn's has been around for hundreds of years, but rising electricity costs now threaten its survival (Credit: Eibhlis Gale-Coleman)Even the best-laid plans are vulnerable, though, and Nicola recounted some bumps in the road.
In 2019, an ice storm damaged the electricity generator and left guests and staff sitting in candlelight for an evening.
And once, the diesel was stolen, again leaving the inn with no electricity.
""Our breakfast chef cooked breakfast on a BBQ, and I boiled water on the fire in the main bar to make tea and coffee.
We had an emergency delivery of diesel later that day,"" she said.All too soon, it was time to settle my bill and head back onto the moorland roads to skid my way home.
Tan Hill's strength is its sheer entrepreneurial drive and family spirit, a resilience instilled by centuries of weathering the elements.
Every day brings a new idea, event and problem to solve.I'll be keeping my eye on the Northern Lights predictions this month.

travel,"Loreto Pacitti was stumped.
He was desperate.
The pecorino producer couldn't sell one of Italy's most famous cheeses.
No one could.
Covid had closed restaurants and public markets, skyrocketed production costs and curbed public spending.
Worried his cheese would spoil, he did what his ancestors did hundreds of years ago.He buried his cheese in a cave.
""During the lockdown I lost almost everything,"" said Pacitti, owner of La Caciosteria di Casa Lawrence in the village of Picinisco in the Lazio region.
""But then because of this system [of burying cheese] I recovered everything.
""Pecorino, a strong, hard, savoury, salty cheese made from sheep's milk, comes in a variety of styles, such as fresco, which is light and typically used in salads; semi-stagionato, which is aged for about 60 days and often eaten with bread or fruit; and stagionato, which is sharper, more brittle and aged for 36 months.
Gennargentu di Pitzalis Bruno, a manufacturer outside Rome near the town of Bracciano, makes 26 different pecorinos.As Rome restaurant owner Massimo Innocenti said, ""Pecorino is really the final food.
I always thought that if I was on a deserted island and I had pecorino, it would be perfect.
""Innocente is up close and personal with Pecorino.
Under the floor of his restaurant, Necci dal 1924, is a 2,000-year-old cave left over from the Roman Empire where he stores all his pecorino.
""Pecorino"" is the name given to all Italian cheeses made from ewe's milk; the word itself stems from the word pecora, meaning ""sheep"".
However, not all pecorino is the same.
Eight, high-quality versions have been given D.O.P.
status by the European Union, including Pecorino Romano (originating from the Lazio region near Rome), Pecorino Toscano (from Tuscany) and Pecorino Sardo (from Sardinia).
Of these, Pecorino Romano is perhaps the most popular and the oldest.
And while a few remaining high-end producers still make Pecorino Romano in Lazio, much of it is now produced in Sardinia (not to be confused with Pecorino Sardo).Pecorino Romano, a version originally hailing from the Lazio region near Rome (hence the name ""Romano""), is the cheese that defines the Italian kitchen.
It's lighter, drier and saltier than other pecorino varieties, and bonds so many Italian dishes such as cacio e pepe, pasta carbonara and bucatini all'amatriciana (a typical Roman dish made of pasta, pig's cheek and tomatoes).
It's seasoned for up to two years and is delicious with a dab of honey and a glass of wine.
And it has been around Italy for 2,000 years.During the Roman Republic (508-27 BCE), shepherds needed to do something with their excess sheep's milk and so they made what is Pecorino Romano.
The Roman Empire's renowned agricultural writer, Lucio Moderato Columella, wrote about what appeared to be Pecorino Romano in 50 CE in De Re Rustica.
Turns out, Pecorino Romano was an ideal food for Roman armies as it had a lifespan longer than many soldiers.
In the Middle Ages, people started adding salt to Pecorino Romano and discovered that it helped preserve the cheese.
Soon, it spread beyond the Italian peninsula.Pecorino Romano has survived the fall of the Roman Empire, earthquakes and fascism.
""Pecorino Romano is like a Roman soldier,"" said Rome-based food writer Rachel Alice Roddy.
""It's meant to be a working cheese.
""Despite its name, Pecorino Romano is sold on a large scale as it is used primarily in the home kitchen.
This mass-produced version, affordable and readily available in supermarkets across Italy, not only survived Covid, it thrived.
During Italy's lockdowns, families stocked up on it.
In fact, sales went up during Covid, going from 26,940 tons sold in 2019 to 34,280 last year.Artisanal pecorinos, meanwhile, nearly became another Covid victim when restaurants and public markets closed, and producers wondered what they'd do with factories full of cheese going bad fast.
And so, they resorted to selling it door to door.
They grew their own corn to combat the growing cost of sheep feed.
And they buried it in caves to preserve it for a later date.During Covid, Loreto Pacitti started burying his pecorino (Credit: Fausto Caserio)Pacitti said, ""I tried to sell to the people door to door.
I opened an online market, but it wasn't working very well.
Then I changed the production scheme.""
In July 2020, he made bigger cheeses so he could preserve more at one time and took them to Emilia-Romagna in central Italy where he buried them in a cave of tufa stone 4m deep.Hundreds of years ago, people hid their food in similar caves, known as fossa.
""Even the cheeses,"" Pacitti said.
""Then they discovered the cheeses became better with longer shelf life.""
According to Innocenti, ""In Europe, the practice of ripening cheeses in underground pits dates back to the Middle Ages and was used to protect food from the raids of occasional invaders.""
Over time; however, it became less common for producers to use the fossa and the practice faded.Pacitti filled his cave and sealed it for three months, allowing the cheese to eat all the oxygen, mature and develop in flavour.
His Pecorino Picinisco, for example, becomes spicy and crumbly in the mouth with hints of porcino mushrooms and chestnuts.
Now it's one of his most popular sellers.
The process also extends the cheese's life to 18 to 24 months instead of five to six.
""When I eat the pecorino in the fossa, I'm in a good mood because the pecorino in the fossa is very strong,"" said Romina, his wife and co-proprietor.La Caciosteria di Casa Lawrence in Picinisco makes artisanal pecorino (Credit: Marina Pascucci)Not far away in Settefrati, Maria Pia and brother Antonio are ninth-generation shepherds.
Every June, they take their sheep 17km to a plain 1,000m up.
The sheep supply pecorino for their family's Agricola San Maurizio business.However, production costs tripled on feed for the animals, electricity for their factory and gas for the tractors.
""The animals eat and don't know we had Covid,"" Maria said.To combat costs, they grew their own corn.
They now make 12,000 kilos a year and save €20 (about £18) per 100 kilos.
To the Pias, pecorino is their lifeblood.
""It is my family food,"" Maria said.
""Every day, we have a different picture of our work.
It represents the little farmers, the identity and tradition.
""At Gennargentu di Pitzalis Bruno, marketing director Silvano Secchi recalled the throes of Covid when sales and Italians' income flatlined.Silvano Secchi: ""It's difficult to find people who are willing to pay for quality"" (Credit: Marina Pascucci)""It's difficult to find people who are willing to pay for quality,"" he said.
""Because people have less money and can't spend money for quality cheese and so it's very difficult to sell pecorino which costs €40 (£35.50) a kilo.""
Fuel during Covid went from €0.50 (£0.44) a litre to €1.30 (£1.15).
Overall expenses increased 60%.
They upped their prices 10% and sales dropped 25%.
""We organised some other things,"" Secchi said.
""Otherwise, it would've been 80%.
""Secchi and owner, Bruno Pitzalis, started online sales, shipped cheese and sold home to home.
To attract business, they gave away free ricotta, made from leftover sheep's milk that's recooked after the production of other cheeses.
ARSIAL, the regional association for agricultural development, gave them €10,000 (£8,900) for a website.Helping his recovery was one of his best clients, Massimo Innocenti, the owner of restaurant Necci dal 1924 and its 2,000-year-old cave.In 2006, Innocenti bought the restaurant, which has occupied a corner in the gritty Pigneto neighbourhood of south-east Rome since 1924.
However, it wasn't until July 2020, when he decided to build a wine cellar, that he discovered there was an open space under the floor.Massimo Innocenti stores pecorino in Necci dal 1924's 2,000-year-old cave (Credit: Marina Pascucci)""We didn't dig,"" he said.
""We just lifted some tiles.
Just 10cm down were just concrete and iron bars.
They closed it like a tomb.""
What they found was a sprawling cave that dates to the Roman Empire.
The Ancient Romans used it to store pozzolana, a volcanic sand used in making cement.
Innocenti spent eight months turning it into a cheese cellar and started creating and storing different pecorinos.
Since then, he has been using different varieties of pecorino on cheese plates and in dishes at the restaurant.His kitchen maestro, Shahin Gazi, who first learned to cook seafood in his mom's kitchen in Bangladesh, came to Necci in 2010.
""I'm a pecorino fan,"" said Gazi.
""It's good to pair with sharp and aggressive ingredients.
It's why it's perfect for Roman cuisine because Roman cuisine is the homeland of sharp tastes and aggressive tastes.
""Take Necci's Jewish-style artichoke in Pecorino Romano cream and paprika croutons.
The artichoke is deep fried on a bed of thick pecorino sauce.
Even for someone who doesn't like artichokes(such as this writer), the Pecorino made it more than palatable.Massimo Innocenti uses different varieties of pecorino in dishes at Necci dal 1924 (Credit: Marina Pascucci)""Artichoke is the most difficult thing to pair in the kitchen,"" Gazi said.
""It's an eternal fight with all the ingredients.
They fight together.
Pecorino is a great match because both are strong and powerful.
From this fight between two ingredients is born a great friendship.
""Then there is the pici di grano saraceno (buckwheat pasta with pumpkin, pig's cheek and chestnuts in a Pecorino Romano sauce).
""All the ingredients in this pasta are very strong and aggressive flavours,"" Gazi said.
""We have the sweetness of the pumpkin, and we have the saltiness of the guanciale (pig's cheek).
""The highlight of the menu may be the pan-fried prawn salad served in a Pecorino Romano basket with leeks, ginger and balsamic vinegar reduction.
After eating the balsamic-coated shrimp, you eat the basket like a giant pecorino cracker.
""Every pecorino has a different taste,"" said Agathe Jaubourg, Innocenti's wife and co-owner.
""It touches many different aspects of the taste.
It can be sweet; it can be spicy.
It's very interesting with wine.
When you have wine, the taste changes.
""But after 2,000 years, some things never change, such as the longevity of pecorino, which even Covid couldn't end.BBC.com's World's Table ""smashes the kitchen ceiling"" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.--- Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.If you liked this story,  sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called ""The Essential List"".

travel,"It was Fiji Day in Suva, the compact capital of the island-nation of Fiji and the South Pacific's largest city.
Near a parked taxi draped in light-blue national flags, I turned left off Victoria Parade and into Albert Park.
It was here, on 9 October 1970, that then-Prince Charles granted Fiji its independence after 96 years of British rule, which Fiji Day commemorates.Detecting barbecue smoke, I followed my nose, weaving between picnicking young families and men throwing a rugby ball, to a line of food stalls.
Several were selling British-style pork sausages in white buns, while others were hawking more tantalising tandoori-style chicken.
Such British and Indian influences are an inescapable part of modern-day Fiji, but they are far removed from the Fiji that I had come to know and love during my time on Fiji's remote island of Taveuni.The tagimoucia only grows on one of Fiji's 330 islands, Taveuni (Credit: Ben McKechnie)A week ago, in search of an extremely rare flower called the tagimoucia (pronounced tahng-ee-mow-theea), I travelled to Taveuni – Fiji's ""Garden Island"".
The tagimoucia is Fiji's endemic and elusive national flower, as well as one of the rarest flowers on Earth.
Its bright crimson and white petals grow in clusters, and from a young age, all Fijians are taught that the disparate colours symbolise a beautiful but tragic love story between two disparate people – a sort of Fijian Romeo and Juliet that has captured the country's imagination.Yet while the tagimoucia features prominently in Fijian folk and popular culture, many Fijians may have only seen the bloom in pictures – in 2013, an image of the tagimoucia was used to replace Queen Elizabeth II on the front of the Fijian 50-dollar note.
Of Fiji's 330 islands, the tagimoucia only grows on Taveuni, and it's only found on a mountain ridge beside a difficult-to-access, high-altitude lake, where it blooms for less than three months of the year.Because of its uniqueness, the tagimoucia has come to be seen by Fijians as something of a national treasure as well as a symbol of good luck and fortune.
On graduation days in Suva, the flower is commonly requested by high school and university students, who place it in their graduation garlands.
In 2021, Fijian pop star KKU devoted an entire song to the tagimoucia, and the music video shows him travelling to Taveuni in search of the flower before dancing on the beach with it behind his ears.I first heard of the tagimoucia while searching for the most challenging trek in Fiji and was immediately intrigued.
So, after a few days on Fiji's second island of Vanua Levu to get over my jetlag, I set out in search of this most elusive plant.A ferry whisks travellers from Savusavu to the island of Taveuni (Credit: Ben McKechnie)I boarded a bus for a two-hour ride through the central mountains of Vanua Levu to the southern coastal town of Savusavu, where I would catch the ferry to Taveuni.As we crossed the glistening Somosomo Strait to Taveuni, my eyes were drawn upward to the mountain ridge in its centre, where the tagimoucia hides on and around Des Voeux peak (1,195m).
Upon arriving, I took a taxi to the main village of Somosomo to meet my hosts for the next four days: a local couple named Amoreena and Tabua Tikoilawaqa.Amoreena introduced me to her 80-year-old mother, Filomena Mitchell.
When I told Mitchell that I hoped to see the tagimoucia, her eyes lit up: ""It is smaller and more delicate that you would expect!
I've seen the tagimoucia twice.
Both times were in 1965 when I was a nurse posted to a nursing station on the east coast.
Back then, it was easier to go up from that side.
You'll be going up from the west.
It's a tough hike – go carefully!""
she urged.Meanwhile, Amoreena told me the famous legend of the tagimoucia.Amoreena and Tabua Tikoilawaqa are originally from the island of Qamea (Credit: Ben McKechnie)""Tabua and I are from Qamea, the small island that lies off the coast of Taveuni's north-eastern tip.
Long ago, the tribes of Somosomo and Qamea were at war.
In a case of forbidden love, the Somosomo chief's daughter had promised her heart to a Qamea warrior, while her father had pledged her hand to another.
The Somosomo chief found out and ordered the Qamea warrior killed.
The girl climbed to the peak of the island, distraught, and lay down in the dirt, scratching and kicking in devastated throes at the thought of losing her lover.
This [digging] is how Lake Tagimoucia was formed, and her tears became the first tagimoucia flowers.
As the Qamea warrior was killed, the two main colours of the flower came to represent two lovers who have been separated by death in Fijian culture.""
In Fijian culture, one should offer kava powder as a gift upon arriving in any tribal village in order to enter and be seen by the elders.
This is an ancient rule that applies to both Fijians and visitors.
As more people have come to Tavuki to request to see the tagimoucia, the villagers started charging five Fijian dollars in place of the bag of kava, as money is of greater benefit to the community.The tagimoucia (Medinilla waterhousei) is a species of flowering liana – long-stemmed woody vines that can climb trees to the canopy in search of direct sunlight.
From the thin vine that sprouts from the volcanic soil of Taveuni's mountainous interior, 30cm-long clusters of crimson and white tear-shaped petals droop down – two distinct parts of the same flower.
It is believed that the plant needs a very specific composition of volcanic soil, as all attempts to transplant the vine to other Fijian islands and countries have failed.The next day, I took a car to the village of Tavuki, where the Des Voeux peak trailhead starts.
Local tribal traditions dictate that before setting off in search of the tagimoucia, anyone – Fijians and visitors alike – must ask permission from village elders.
Amoreena had told me I needed to find a man named Samuela Vagoni, and I soon spotted the bald man with a goatee hammering a nail inside a tiny hut.
Vagoni puffed out his chest, cleared his throat and said, ""By the power vested in me by the village elders of Tavuki and Somosomo, I Samuela Vagoni have the authority to request from you the sum of five Fijian dollars [£1.85] to pass this point and ascend to see the tagimoucia.""
With the formalities over, we continued chatting.
""I'm here from 08:00, but some people go up earlier to avoid paying.
I just charge them 10 Fijian dollars on the way down!""
he said with a grin.Village elders recommend hiring a guide for anyone trying to see the tagimoucia (Credit: Ben McKechnie)Vagoni also told me that I'd be foolish to ascend the mountain without a guide.
""The first three-quarters of the way up, you'll be on the steep service road to the Des Voeux phone tower, but then you must cut into the rainforest on an unmarked track to have any chance of finding the tagimoucia.
There's thick fog and it's always raining,"" he said.
""At best, you don't find the flower.
At worst, you get completely lost and we have to send police and a village search party.
""I asked Vagoni whether this worst-case scenario has happened before.
""Frequently!""
he said.
""Just two weeks ago, a group of seven Fijians went up without a guide and got lost in the cloud.
There was a search-and-rescue mission.
What a mess!
""Luckily, I was in the market for a guide, and we agreed on the sum of 50 Fijian dollars (£18.60).
Vagoni returned 10 minutes later with Saki Talemaivesi, his 16-year-old relative, and we set out up the service road.I've hiked Kilimanjaro and made it to the Everest Base Camp.
However, I quickly discovered that Taveuni's extreme humidity and the trail's unrelenting steepness make ascending Des Voeux astonishingly tough.
I needed to stop to rest every 10 minutes, which allowed me to gaze out over the sweeping views of Somosomo Straight and back towards Vanua Levu.The tagimoucia represents a sort of Fijian Romeo and Juliet that has captured the country's imagination (Credit: Ben McKechnie)An hour later, Talemaivesi told me to wait while he darted into the forest.
""Come on!
This way!""
I heard him shout after a few minutes.
I followed him onto an unmarked jungle trail, ducking under fallen trees and scaling other obstacles.
After 30 minutes, he pointed up at the canopy excitedly.
""Look!
The tagimoucia!""
he shouted.
I couldn't believe we'd found it – I also couldn't see a thing, as my glasses were completely steamed up.
I asked whether there was a way to hook the vine down to look at the flower up close without cutting it.
Talemaivesi obliged, and I finally had a peek at this rarest and most elusive of flowers.Mitchell was right: the tagimoucia is small, like the tip of an adult's thumb.
I examined the flower's two distinct parts – a crimson outer shell, from which a white flower with a purple crown and yellow filaments burst, as if it was trying to escape.
Then, I went in for a sniff, but was surprised to find that the tagimoucia has almost no scent whatsoever.
And as I gazed at it, I realised the journey to get to this incredibly remote spot had been as exciting as finding the flower itself.After a sudden downpour, we squelched back the way we came.
The rain continued for hours all the way down the mountain, and by the time I made it back to Somosomo where the Tikoilawaqas and Mitchell were waiting, I looked like a drowned rat.Locals say it always rains along the trail to see the tagimoucia (Credit: Horizon Internal Images/Alamy)Finding the tagimoucia on any attempt is far from a given, so the family were thrilled to see my pictures.
My visit had coincided with the annual migration of lairo (red land crabs), which occurs for a few days around the full moon in November.
Amoreena announced that to celebrate there would be a dinner of freshly caught lairo with coconut milk and lime juice, served with steamed taro.
The acidity of the lime and sweetness of the coconut balanced the earthy bitterness of the crabs, and I felt my energy being restored.As I flew back to Suva two days later, I glimpsed down and saw the service road, peaks and rainforest where I had trekked just two days ago.
I thought back to something that Mitchell said to me over a plate of crispy fried breadfruit.
When I told her that I couldn't detect any scent to the tagimoucia flower, she laughed and said, ""Oh, you're half right, I suppose.
The tagimoucia does have a smell though – a strong, beautiful one.
It's just not here on Taveuni.
""Seeing my perplexed look, she explained her version of the famous legend.
""We're from Qamea, where the tagimoucia is originally from.
Hundreds of years ago, our tribe's chief gave the flower as a gift of peace to the Somosomo tribe.
This is how it came to Taveuni.
But the smell did not go with it.
Even today, the scent lingers there on our island Qamea.
It's especially strong in the evening.
""Some say the scent of tagimoucia lingers on Qamea (Credit: Wirestock Inc/Alamy)Mitchell took a swig of hot lemongrass tea and continued.
""One time, in the '60s, I remember being in a boat in the dark, somewhere between Qamea and Taveuni.
The smell of the tagimoucia's sweet perfume suddenly drifted out to sea, surrounding us in the boat.
I remember thinking, perhaps this is the time the Somosomo girl and the Qamea warrior used to meet.
""On Taveuni, I sensed the boundaries of history, legends and fantasy tend to blur.
But, on my last night on the island, I stood on the shore and looked out across waves lit by the moonlight.
Breathing slowly, I strained my senses and tried to catch a trace of the tagimoucia.
Now, if I told you that I think I caught a whiff, would you believe me?--- Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called ""The Essential List"".

travel,"The Basque town of Mutriku owes its soul to the sea.
It sits wedged into a bay carved out of the rugged, steep cliffs of Spain's northern coast, roughly 50km north-east of Bilbao.
The coastline here is a geological marvel, created by powerful storms and relentless waves that left behind flowing, jagged layers of fine shale known as flysch that stretch out into the ocean like pages of an ancient book.For centuries, the same ocean has enriched residents of this coastal town.
Formed as a fishing village more than 800 years ago, Mutriku grew alongside Basque commerce through the Middle Ages to become a thriving port, home to generations of fisherfolk, traders, shipbuilders and whalers.
Sailors from Mutriku ventured as far as the Gulf of St Lawrence to hunt seals, whales and cod.
The products they brought back fuelled leather industries in Mutriku and across Europe.
Mutriku's whalers were such renowned experts that as early as the 13th Century, the Spanish crown demanded a whale from the town as an annual tribute.
Mutriku is ""one of the best-preserved medieval towns in the Basque Country and its entire history has been linked to the sea,"" said Violeta Bandrés, a guide at the Mutriku Tourism Office.
""It is a history of fishermen, navigators, sailors; men and women whose lives unfolded in this environment.
""The flysch in northern Spain are geological phenomena caused by the erosion of the sea over millions of years (Credit: Jarcosa/Getty Images)From the sea wall at the mouth of the bay, I watched as a team of rowers, lined up in a trainera (a streamlined sporting boat once used to hunt fish and whales), powered out of the port into the glistening Cantabrian Sea, past criss-crossing jet skis and a yacht sailing lazily back into harbour.
Families splashed around in natural tidal pools, cooling off from the midday heat.
But while the ocean remains a source of pleasure and income for locals, it's now serving a new purpose: as an immense source of power.In 2011, the town installed the Mutriku Wave Energy Plant, the first commercial wave power plant in Europe.
Harnessing the force of the waves, the plant's 16 turbines generate up to 296 kilowatts of electricity, enough to power around 250 homes and cut 600 tonnes of carbon emissions each year.
In 2020, the plant hit a major milestone, producing two gigawatts of cumulative electricity, a record for any wave plant and an example of the role marine power could play in the global transition towards clean energy.I was in Mutriku to find out more about this latest chapter in the Basques' long and prosperous history with the ocean.
As I walked through the town, an M C Escher-like maze of stone stairways and zig-zagging narrow cobbled streets, I found mementos of the town's distinguished seafaring past scattered throughout – many of them open to public viewing.At the corner of one street was an 18th-Century Baroque mansion built by José Montalivet y Forjado, a famous captain and naval engineer.
In the town square stood a statue of Cosme Damián Churruca y Elorza, an admiral of the Spanish Armada who died fighting in the Battle of Trafalgar.
(A painting depicting his death is on display in Madrid's Prado Museum).
Tucked along a residential street, I passed the stone façade of the Arrietakua Palace, once home to the ship builder Antonio de Gaztañeta, whose designs revolutionised the Spanish fleet.
Down a steep street leading down to the sea, I reached the gothic arches of the Antigua Lonja, an old fish market standing at the edge of the harbour just as it did in the 15th Century.Mutriku was formed as a fishing village more than 800 years ago, and the old fish market still stands on the harbour (Credit: Richard Kemeny)Hundreds of years of architectural tinkering have created a town that exists in harmony with the sea.
The port's original design (known as ""The Seashell"") was innovative for the 13th Century, with two stone breakwaters protecting incoming ships from the choppy seas.
An overhaul in the late 19th Century gave the port its current layout, and a Basque engineer tweaked the walls in 1932 to better protect the town against incoming waves.
Large fishing vessels of the past have mostly disappeared; today the marina is filled with rows of small white sailing boats bobbing in the breeze.Tours of the plant can be organised by the Mutriku tourism office.
(They need to be booked in advance).
While they're mostly in Basque or Spanish, English-speaking guides can be arranged too.Duration: 60minPrice: €2 per personThe tourism office also runs tours to the surrounding coastline (Geopark) and to see the flysch formations.Walking out further, I passed the town's two natural tidal pools that fill up with seawater and grateful swimmers on hot summer days.
At the end of the port, stretching out to sea was another breakwater, a 440m-long Brutalist wall of concrete and stone that arced out like a protective arm across the bay.
It was built to shield the town from storms and strong ocean currents, but spotting an opportunity to gain something further from the sea, the Basque government built the wave energy plant inside.Mutrikuarra (inhabitants of Mutriku) call it ""El Drágon"" (The Dragon), and when the waves hit and the turbines roar, it's easy to hear why.
I was greeted outside the plant by Jon Lekube, an engineer at Ente Vasco de la Energía (EVE) who's in charge of running it.
We headed up to the top of the breakwater and stood looking out to sea as waves rolled in steadily from the north.
""Today we have waves around 1m high,"" Lekube said.
""But we can have up to five or six.
""Even on this relatively calm day, as we talked a deep groaning sound rose up through the stone below.
The dragon was waking.
We headed down the stairs towards a pair of steel doors guarding the entrance to the plant, and Lekube handed me a pair of ear defenders.
""If you've got any questions, you might want to ask them now,"" he said, smiling.
I put them on, as we stepped inside to a deafening roar.The wave energy plant was built inside the town's breakwater in 2011 (Credit: Richard Kemeny)The system is designed to get as much from the waves that batter the coast while protecting the turbines from the corrosive effects of the sea water.
When a wave arrives, it compresses air upwards through chambers that rise up from below the waterline into the belly of the structure.
The high-pressure air drives a turbine, generating electricity that is fed straight into the grid.
As the wave falls away, it drags air back through the turbine, creating more electricity on the way out.We walked around the concrete interior of the plant as it filled with an orchestra of sound.
Crashing waves met with haunting growls from the turbines, followed by the high-pitched whistles of pressurised air.
Some spray spat out of one of the chambers – even though the design offers some protection, there is no escaping the ocean here.
Lekube pointed to metal structures on the ceiling that looked like air-conditioning units, and large tiled panels along the walls.
All of this is to stop sound escaping, he shouted over the din.Mutriku's location in the Bay of Biscay means waves roll in pretty much all year-round – the same reason surfers from all over the world visit the coastline from Bilbao to Biarritz.
Sailors, though, have long feared the bay's violent winter storms, which have caused numerous shipwrecks, even in recent years.
However, the constant barrage that once threatened Mutriku's ships and citizens is now a source of clean power.
It also makes the Mutriku plant an ideal testing location for new marine technologies: one chamber is set up so that companies can bring their prototype turbines or generators to see how they fare in a harsh ocean setting.
These experiments could help bring costs for wave technology down in the future.The plant's 16 turbines generate up to 296 kilowatts of electricity, enough to power around 250 homes (Credit: Agefotostock/Alamy)Standing back outside where we could talk, Lekube explained that the plant is a natural next step in Basque maritime history.
It fits into a broader goal of the Basque government to make Basque Country a ""polo de conocimiento"" (a global knowledge hub) for marine renewable technology.
The idea is to build on the region's historical expertise with the ocean, drawing on generations of knowledge harboured in their universities and taking advantage of the proximity of the sea, ""so that Basque companies are ultimately in the vanguard of marine energy,"" he said.
""Naval industry is our tradition.
""This tradition could become more valuable as Europe moves towards a greener energy mix.
Currently, wave energy is still a largely untapped resource, as the technology is decades behind that of its renewable cousins, solar and wind.
But estimates suggest the global potential of waves alone is enough to meet Europe's energy demand 10 times over.
Interest and investment is growing across Europe for projects that can tap into energy from the ocean, from waves and tides.
""We're still missing a lot of potential from what the water can give us,"" said Lekube.The needs of the world may have changed, but Basques have always found a way to use the sea to their advantage.
In Mutriku, although industrial fishing has declined – a combination of economic pressures, and because younger generations don't want to spend days out at sea – the link with the ocean is still very important, said Bandrés.
""The inhabitants and visitors of Mutriku enjoy the natural pools of sea water located in the port, the passion for rowing or fishing is very strong and of course they enjoy the beaches and the natural environment of the town,"" she added.
""The sea has been, is and will be a fundamental part of life for Mutrikuarra.

travel,"""Welcome to Jordan!""
a group of kids shouted excitedly, as I stepped out of the car to admire the sun setting over the vast sandstone canyon of Wadi Mujib.
While I stood on the cliff's edge, awestruck by the mountain ranges stretching to the Dead Sea, a black-and-white hooded wheatear swooped down near me.
I wondered how something so delicate could survive in such desolate ravines, fluttering across the arid mountains and building nests in rock crevices.From my perch, I could see a narrow, serpentine road winding down the ridges and gorges.
This route, known as the King's Highway, or Darb ar-Raseef (""paved road"", in Arabic), is believed to be one of the world's oldest continuously used roads.
For millennia, merchants, pilgrims, warriors and kings travelled north to south through Jordan's central highlands, and this thoroughfare served as a vital artery connecting ancient kingdoms and empires.The King's Highway has been used continuously since at least the 8th Century BCE (Credit: Anna Stowe Travel/Alamy)Today, a modern, tarmacked road (officially called Highway 35) sits atop its ancient ancestor.
It runs south from Syria along the Jordan River, passing through Roman ruins, Byzantine mosaics, Crusader castles and the ancient city of Petra – effectively revealing the history of Jordan and linking some of its most important historical sites.
""This route was used in the Nabataean period [4th Century BCE to roughly 106 CE], and probably even before that, in the Iron Age,"" said Fawzi Abudanah, an archaeologist who has studied the region's ancient road system.A road traversing Jordan known as the ""King's Highway"" is mentioned in the Bible's Old Testament as the route that Moses asked permission to cross after leading the Israelites out of Egypt.
As Abudanah explained, since there is archaeological evidence showing Edomite, Nabataean, Roman, Byzantine and Islamic presence along much of the current highway, it suggests that this road has been in continuous use since at least the 8th Century BCE.
""We keep following the footsteps of our ancestors,"" he said.According to Abudanah, in ancient times, the King's Highway was an important trade route connecting Arabia, the Fertile Crescent, the Red Sea and Egypt.
Caravans transporting incense and spices from Arabia took this road on their way to the thriving Nabataean capital of Petra.
In the Roman period, emperor Trajan (who reigned between 98-117 CE) renamed the route Via Nova Traiana and paved it to accommodate wheeled carts.
""We can still find Roman milestones on the side of the modern road,"" Abudanah said.Caravans carrying spices once travelled along the highway to Petra (Credit: Travel Wild/Alamy)For centuries, the road was also an important pilgrimage route.
In the Byzantine period, Christians used it on their way to visit biblical sites in the Holy Land, such as Golgotha, the site of Jesus crucifixion.
In the early Islamic period, many Muslims travelled along it on their way to Mecca.I lived in Amman, Jordan's capital on and off for several years, but always took the faster, easier roads heading south.
When my cousin came to visit me, we decided the best way to explore the country's long and tangled history was to take the King's Highway and travel slowly along the path that the many civilisations who have shaped this ancient land once used.The ancient road once passed by Amman's highest hill, occupied since the Bronze Age.
So before leaving the capital, we wandered among the ruins of a Roman temple, a Byzantine church and an Umayyad palace, which reflect the history of Jordan's layered heritage.We then travelled 30km south – past olive orchards, ripening pomegranates and rows of prickly pears – to the ancient town of Madaba.
""The road crosses the most fertile part of the country, the area where you have springs and water sources, but also agricultural land.
It's the backbone of Jordan,"" Abudanah told me.The 6th-Century mosaic map inside the St George Orthodox church shows sites along the King's Highway (Credit: Yadid Levy/Alamy)Madaba is best known for its collection of Byzantine-era mosaics.
The most famous of them, the remains of a 6th-Century floor mosaic housed in the modest St George Orthodox church, is considered the oldest surviving map of the Holy Land, and depicts various sites linked by the King's Highway.
Near the church's altar, I tried to decipher the Greek captions indicating Jerusalem in the centre of the map, and marvelled at the details of fish swimming in the River Jordan and boats on the Dead Sea.
Nine kilometres west of Madaba, a short detour from the King's Highway led us to Mount Nebo, where Moses purportedly first saw the Promised Land, and where he's believed to have died and been buried.In the Old Testament, Moses asks the King of Edom to pass through his land in what is now south-western Jordan.
""We will stay on the main road until we leave your territory,"" he promised.
But his request to travel along the King's Highway was denied.
The modern road is far more welcoming – I was told ""Welcome to Jordan"" dozens of times, and was offered tea and invited for lunch and dinner by many locals I met along the road.
""People here are so kind and generous,"" said Sabine Hendriks, a Dutch tourist cycling along the King's Highway with her partner, heading south to the Red Sea port of Aqaba.
""When we couldn't cycle up a very steep hill, a truck stopped to help us.
It was already full, but somehow they managed to find space for us.
""The Kerak Castle is one the biggest and best-preserved Crusader fortresses in the Middle East (Credit: Marta Vidal)On a quick stop to stretch our legs, a young man working in a bakery by the side of the road told us we were his guests and brought us a tray of sweets and warm date bread.
Satiated, we continued south across the gently undulating plateau towards the Unesco World Heritage site of Umm ar-Rasas.
When we reached the archaeological site it was already closing time, but a friendly guard named Alaa let us in anyway and offered to show us around.
Once a Roman garrison town, the site houses ruins from the Roman, Byzantine and Early Islamic periods.
While we walked to the remains of an 8th-Century church (monastic Christianity was tolerated during Islamic rule), Alaa asked us to close our eyes, and we were only allowed to open them when we were in front of the site's renowned mosaics.
I stood there consumed by the ancient towns and pomegranate trees depicted on the church's floor, wondering how the mosaics remained so vivid after more than 1,200 years.We travelled along the valleys and rolling hills dotted with oak, cypress and juniper trees, the landscape becoming increasingly arid, and watched the sunset at Wadi Mujib.
The next morning, we explored the medieval castle in the city of Kerak.
Built in 1142 and retaken by Muslims in 1188, it is one the biggest and best-preserved Crusader fortresses in the Middle East.
Fuad, a local guide, led us through the castle's many floors, some buried so deep we needed a torch to see the vaulted halls and underground chambers.
He asked us to imagine Saladin, the legendary sultan who defeated the Crusaders, sitting there on a throne, their battles playing out against the backdrop of the ancient highway.Continuing south along the meandering road, we passed by the Dana Biosphere Reserve, Jordan's largest and most diverse protected region.
Spread over 292 sq km, this mountainous swath of the Great Rift Valley shifts from towering sandstone cliffs to desert plains.
The plan was to visit the town of Shobak's imposing medieval castle.
But instead, we stopped on a curvy by-road in the arid hills to drink coffee with Mohammad ""Abu Ali"" Al-Malaheem.
When the former tour guide retired, he decided to build what he calls ""the world's smallest hotel"" – a battered Volkswagen Beetle lovingly decorated with his daughter's embroidery – that's become so popular, it has been visited by Jordan's King Abdullah II.Abu Ali's ""world's smallest hotel"" has been visited by Jordan's King Abudllah II (Credit: Marta Vidal)Abu Ali gifted me a colourful beaded necklace made by local women.
His generosity and endearing roadside hotel reminded me that while the King's Highway might have lost its importance as a major trade route, it's the people who you meet and experiences you have along the way that bring it to life.After a purposefully slow, two-day, 250km road trip, we reached our final destination: Petra, which was declared one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.
Few places can rival the splendour of the ancient Nabataean city carved out of red sandstone in the arid desert.
Petra was once a great mercantile city at the crossroads of empires and ancient trade routes, and the road used by Nabataean caravans that made the region prosperous is now trodden by tourists who come from all over the world to visit the site's more-than-2,000-year-old temples, tombs and altars intricately carved into the narrow canyons.
Later that day, we stopped on a road outside of Petra to give a ride to a woman walking home after a long day selling souvenirs at the site's archaeological park.
She introduced herself as Umm Khaled and, despite being exhausted from work, she invited us to her home in a nearby village.The road now known as the King's Highway helped make Petra so prosperous (Credit: Jan Wlodarczyk/Alamy)Most of the Bedouin tribes in the area still depend on the Nabataean paths.
Umm Khaled, who belongs to the Ammarin tribe, told me how difficult it was to make ends meet when the roads were emptied of visitors during the pandemic, and how her family is still struggling.
Insisting I come back for tea, Umm Khaled showed me how, even through hardship, she and many others are able to make the desert a hospitable place.Heading back to Amman with the promise to visit her again, I thought about the black-and-white bird I saw in the ravine of Wadi Mujib and how throughout history, people here have managed to carve extraordinary monuments from these rocks and breathe life into this arid landscape.
The King's Highway not only showcases the most important phases of Jordan's history, but also reveals what makes the country so special: the surprising possibility of finding beauty, kindness and generosity even in the most difficult of places.The Open Road is a celebration of the world's most remarkable highways and byways, and a reminder that some of the greatest travel adventures happen via wheels.---Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.If you liked this story,  sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called ""The Essential List"".

travel,"Hiking through the green valleys and wildflower-strewn meadows under blazing sunshine, with the gunmetal-grey Albanian Alps towering overhead, I was struck by the utter remoteness of this landscape.
Unlike Europe's more famous alpine resorts, there were no hotels or ski lifts in sight.
Instead, the sweeping setting evoked a startling sense of isolation, and I couldn't help but feel I'd entered a back-of-the-wardrobe secret land that had somehow evaded the attention of the outside world.
Stretching from Northern Albania into southern Kosovo and north-eastern Montenegro, the Albanian Alps are better known by their local Albanian (Bjeshkët e Nëmuna) and Serbo-Croatian (Prokletije) names – both of which mean ""The Accursed Mountains"".
Yet, the question of how these serrated limestone slopes got their unusual moniker remains something of a mystery.According to local legend, the devil escaped from hell and created the jagged glacial karsts in a single day of mischief.
Some say the alps' name stems from a woman who cursed the mountains when she was trekking through them with her children on a scorching-hot day and couldn't find any water.
Others claim Slavic soldiers gave the mountains their name as they struggled to march through them.
In a way, the peaks' puzzling origin story is something of a metaphor for Albania as a whole.Albania is filled with up to 500,000 concrete bunkers and was once ""the North Korea of Europe"" (Credit: reidecki/Getty Images)Long called ""Europe's enigma"" by book authors and travel guides, Albania is possibly the most misunderstood country in Europe.
Its language is a semantic anomaly with no known relatives in the Indo-European linguistic family.
After World War Two, authoritarian ruler Enver Hoxha effectively sealed the mountainous nation off from the outside world for four decades; banning religion (and making it the world's first atheist nation); forbidding travel and leading Edi Rama, the nation's current prime minister, to say Albania was once ""the North Korea of Europe"".
During the Cold War, Hoxha convinced the nation that the rest of the world wanted to overthrow their communist state, so he filled the country with up to 500,000 concrete bunkers for people to hide in case of attack.
Curiously, the communist stronghold wasn't always a part of the Eastern Bloc, and since its transition to democracy in 1991, it's never been a member of the European Union.
Instead, it exists as a sort of continental paradox: it's one of only three Muslim-majority nations in Europe (along with neighbouring Kosovo and Bosnia); more Albanians live outside the country (roughly 10 million) than in it (2.8 million); and it's a place where yes means no and no means yes.
For decades, few travellers knew anything about Albania's golden beaches, wild mountains and Roman and Ottoman ruins.
But in the years since the Balkan nation cautiously opened up to the world, it's been wooing travellers keen to discover one of Europe's last wild and least-explored corners.
One of its most audacious projects in recent memory is the Peaks of the Balkans: a 192km circular hiking trail connecting Albania, Montenegro and Kosovo through a series of pathways straddling the Accursed Mountains.
The vision for this cross-border project came about in 2013, but its roots go back much further.
Many Albanians and Kosovars refer to their close relationship as ""one nation, two states"", as highlighted in the popular Albanian slogan ""jemi nje"" (we are one).
In fact, 93% of Kosovars are ethnically Albanian and speak Albanian.
Kosovo (previously part of Serbia) and Montenegro were incorporated into the newly formed Yugoslavia in 1918, but the country's breakup in 1992 triggered a series of fierce ethnic conflicts, as both Serbia and Montenegro are mainly Christian Orthodox.
As a result, hundreds of thousands of Kosavans fled their state, with many crossing the Accursed Mountains into Albania.
In 1999, Nato airstrikes ended a war between Kosovo Albanians and Serbs.
Kosovo eventually won independence in 2008, but tension along these borders continued.The Peaks of the Balkans connects communities of different faiths in three neighbouring nations (Credit: Culture Exclusive/Ben Pipe Photography/Getty Images)In an effort to restore peace, leaders of the three nations suggested a hiking trail linking Muslim, Catholic and Orthodox communities (Serbia and Montenegro were one nation until 2006), with Albanian and Kosovar hiking guides partnering with Montenegrin guesthouses.
Since its opening, the route has boosted local rural economies and helped create a greater connectedness between these far-flung enclaves.
Establishing the trail meant mapping routes known only to shepherds and encouraging farmers to open guesthouses.
A final stamp of approval came when trail planners persuaded authorities from all three countries to waive passport checks at a time when free movement across borders was inconceivable.
To learn more, I'd decided to hike a five-day, 59km section of the trail from the Albanian village of Valbona to the village of Theth.
My adventure began in Albania's capital at the Tirana Airport, where my guides (Mendi from Albania and Agon from Kosovo) from the tour company Zbulo greeted me with big smiles and introduced me to a dozen other hikers from Britain, Germany and New Zealand who formed our group.
After a four-hour drive north, we arrived at Komani Lake, a vast emerald-green reservoir on the Drin River.
To access the Accursed Mountains, we boarded a creaky, old ferry for a three-hour crossing to the Valbona Valley as eagles soared overhead.Former shepherds and farmers now run many of the guesthouses along the trail (Credit: Peter Elia)We hiked along the crystalline Valbona River through an ancient beech forest filled with sweet, wild strawberries and blackberries that I stopped to taste.
After three hours, our guesthouses came into view: a collection of rustic huts facing the Accursed Mountains, which protruded skywards with the sharpness of a crocodile's tooth.
Mustafa, a former shepherd, runs the huts with his two sons, and I asked him why he gave up shepherding to run a guesthouse.
""In my former job, I had many travellers and walkers stay with me, but I never charged money.
A shepherd doesn't just look after animals, but people too,"" he said.
Later, Mendi explained that Mustafa had so many guests staying one night that he persuaded him to change his job.
So, Mustafa used his savings, built more huts and has since dedicated himself to caring for travellers full-time.
The following morning, a gentle two-hour climb saw us reach the summit of Mount Trekufiri (2,366m).
Here, the natural borders of Albania, Kosovo and Montenegro merged into one craggy, panoramic vista.
A weather-beaten sign welcomed us to Albania, and within minutes, my mobile phone provider welcomed me to Montenegro.
Today, these signs are the only indication of the international borders, but it wasn't always this way.
""When I was growing up, wandering in the mountains felt like freedom, but the war meant I couldn't [always] go there,"" Agon told me, as we crossed a rushing stream fed by the mountains' glacial peaks.
""When the war finished, I wanted to be a hiking guide and help children in my town (Gjakova near the Albanian border) to explore their beautiful homeland"" – which is now possible since the introduction of this trail.The Peak of the Balkans Trail straddles the Accursed Mountains and crosses three countries (Credit: Peter Elia)In 1998, when Agon was 13, his father had to protect his family from Yugoslav forces moving in from Serbia and Montenegro as tensions rose between ethnic Albanians, ethnic Serbs and the Yugoslav government.
""We were frightened; no one was coming to help... we had to defend ourselves.""
Agon suddenly became too emotional to talk about what happened any further.
This history is inescapable along the trail; shortly after on a lonely path between shepherds' villages, he pointed to a memorial dedicated to three members of the Kosovo Liberation Army killed there by Serbian forces.
We crossed into Montenegro through moss-covered rocks to the glacial waters of Lake Hrid, its still, glass-like surface reflecting the spiky spruce and pine trees surrounding it.
As the afternoon sun dappled through the thistled canopy, we slowly picked our way downhill.
Suddenly, our accommodation appeared in an idyllic clearing that allowed us to see the impressive vistas of Mount Bogićevića.
The Balkans is famous for its hospitality – and for serving generous portions of food.
Tour operators like Zbulo arrange all accommodation along the trail, and our guesthouse hosts in the hamlet of Babino Polje were Mihajlo and Jelena, a married couple.
Though Mihajlo was proud of his homemade cottage cheese and plum jam, Jelena prepares all their meals.
They are both Christian Ordothdox, and Jelena explained Babino Polje was relatively peaceful until the 1990s.
""Our politicians wanted a conflict and made religion the problem,"" she said.
""Had this path been built 30 years ago, perhaps there would have been no war.
The Peaks of the Balkans trail offers our communities hope.
""Accommodations along the trail range from polished chalets to simple huts, and in the tiny Albanian village of Doberdol near the Montenegro and Kosovo borders, cold showers and squat toilets are the norm.The Accursed Mountains are ""the most inexplicable, the most inaccessible and the wildest mountain range in the Balkans"" (Credit: Peter Elia)Margarita helps run the guesthouse in Doberdol.
Over coffee, she explained: ""I'm old enough to remember when our village was communist.
My family and I are Catholic, and the government could punish us for going to church.""
She also recalled the crippling poverty and paranoia associated with the Hoxha regime.
""Life was hard, but escaping was never an option for me.
If the authorities found out, my family would be in prison, or worse.
""On our last full day, we set off for our most anticipated trek to the region's iconic karst towers of Karanfili (2,461m).
French geologist Ami Boué described this part of the Accursed Mountains as ""the most inexplicable, the most inaccessible and the wildest mountain range in the Balkans"".We hauled ourselves up the steep 800m ascent, nimbly traversing a narrow ridge before reaching the twin peaks, which offered spectacular views of the limestone peaks and Grebaje Valley.
At the summit, we could take in the Accursed Mountains in all their glory.
The mountain range resembled a forbidden, almost Tolkien-esque fortress.Theth is one of the most isolated villages in a historically isolated nation (Credit: Peter Eastland/Alamy)We ended our hike in Theth, an Albanian village encircled by green pastures and imposing mountains whose cold mountain streams flowed under humpbacked Ottoman bridges.
In the early 1900s, English traveller Edith Durham wrote of the village: ""I think no place where human beings live has given me such an impression of majestic isolation from all the world.
""If Albania is Europe's enigma, hiking this trail helped me make sense of the sum of its parts.

travel,"The little karaage, one of the most popular snacks in Japan, is a delicate and intricate version of fried chicken that is a staple across the country.
This delightfully crunchy treat is so beloved that every year, hundreds of thousands of people vote in a country-wide competition to determine which karaage shop serves the best ones.
While shops from massive metropolises like Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka should be dominating any large-scale contest, it's shops from one small town, Nakatsu City, located in the Oita prefecture on the southern island of Kyushu, that typically garner the most awards.The Karaage Grand Prix is the annual competition in Japan whose winner gets to boast that they have the crispiest, juiciest, most flavourful fried chicken, and nearly 1,000 shops enter to compete.
Up until 2022, this contest was based entirely on popularity, with common denizens getting to vote on their favourite places.
But in 2023, the rules are changing, judges are being brought in to taste test, and the true crown for the best karaage will ultimately be rewarded.Why does any of this matter?
And why is this small town of Nakatsu considered to have the best fried chicken in Japan, and quite possibly the world?With the added scrutiny and official tasters coming into play, Nakatsu City karaage shops have more to lose and more to prove than your average shop across the country.
The city's entire reputation as the karaage capital of Japan is now on the line and hundreds of years of cultural culinary history is at stake.First, a definition of karaage (pronounced like ""karate"", except you substitute a hard ""g"" for the ""t""): it's a type of fried chicken that's famous in Japan for both its simplicity of execution and complexity of flavours.
It's a lightly battered bird, mainly using potato starch as a coating, that crisply covers nugget-sized pieces of chicken thighs, breasts, necks and wings that have been marinated in mixtures of soy sauce, ginger, salt, garlic, fruits and other highly secretive ingredients that gives off a taste explosion that dribbles down your chin with every bite.The Karaage Grand Prix is an annual competition for the best fried chicken in Japan (Credit: Karaage festival ExCo)People line up around the block for their favourites and even the late Anthony Bourdain obsessed over them: ""I'm addicted to these deep-fried chicken cutlets… It's a guilty pleasure.
I know exactly where to find a Lawson in Narita International Airport, and I never get on the plane without loading up on these bad boys.""
There's even a karaage movie produced by the Japan Karaage Association dubbing the savoury snack as the ""ultimate national food"".But fundamentally, karaage is the final result of a multi-generational history that spans continents, the age of exploration, cross-cultural pollination, famine and world wars.
It's a fried chicken unlike any other and it's considered the soul food of Nakatsu.The origins of karaage can be traced to the 16th Century when Portuguese missionaries arrived on Japanese shores of Kyushu Island through the port at Nagasaki and brought their fried cooking methods with them.
Slowly, Japanese denizens began to adopt some of these Western ways into what today would be considered tempura.
At the time, however, the Japanese diet was mainly pescatarian, which could be attributed to their Buddhist beliefs.Eating chicken didn't come into the picture until tragedy struck the island nation.
During the Kyōhō era (1716-1736), a widespread famine practically wiped out the rice crop on the island of Kyushu and killed tens of thousands of people.
According to Livestock Production in Kyushu (in Japanese), in order to restore finances, farmers were encouraged to do more poultry farming to sell more eggs and eventually people began to eat chicken once their egg-laying birds had passed their prime.The next major Japanese dietary jump began in 1868, when the new Emperor of Japan embarked on a drastic reformation of society, adopting a cavalcade of Western ideas when it came to industrialisation, military technology and even people's diets.
Emperor Meiji opened the country's borders and allowed more culinary influences from China and the West to permeate the culture – and that meant eating more meat.Tenkatori is run by Yasuhiro Fukuda, the son of the original owner of the first karaage shop in Kyushu (Credit: Karaage festival ExCo)But it wasn't until after World War Two that fried chicken, and in particular karaage, became the touchstone that it is today.
After the war, Japan was decimated, food shortages were rampant, and with a lack of rice, the Japanese diet dramatically changed.
The United States was responsible for importing food and brought in wheat which led to more noodle-based dishes (like ramen), as well as broiler chickens, which are chickens raised for their meat and were easier and faster to raise than cows or pigs.
The island of Kyushu had already become known as a poultry centre (today more than half of all broiler chickens come from Kyushu) and new methods of cooking meat quickly took off and helped nourish a starving country.Karaage itself can trace its roots to a Chinese restaurant named Rairaiken in Nakatsu City's next-door neighbour, Usa City.
It was here in the late 1950s that the establishment began serving deep-fried chicken karaage as part of a set menu.
From there, it jumped across the street to a small izakaya (tavern) named Shosuke, which learned the frying methods from Rairaiken.
The owner of Shosuke was originally buying chickens from local farmers and selling them to butchers while his wife served karaage and sake to eager customers.
But he had a problem: his karaage customers were primarily rice farmers who could only pay for his food and drinks when the rice harvest came in, so he was constantly scrambling for money and barely surviving as a business.
At the same time, bigger farms started industrialising broiler chickens and his chicken-peddling business was becoming less profitable.
""Shosuke quit the izakaya and started the first take-out restaurant serving only karaage.
He also switched his target to housewives who paid cash up front, instead of husbands who paid late and drank [too much] sake,"" said Usa Karaage's US president, Yuko Yoshitake.This pivot to only serving karaage became a major hit as residents of Usa immediately embraced this cheap, fast and delicious source of protein.
Today, Usa boasts more than 40 karaage shops and is one of the hubs of this perfectly crisped fried delight.
But its move to neighbouring Nakatsu is what gave this fried chicken its national and subsequent international reputation.Two chefs, Arata Hosokawa and Shoji Moriyama were both obsessed with karaage, and both felt they could bring out more flavour from the fried food.
According to Yoshitake, in 1970, each man opened his own karaage shop in Nakatsu where they refined the marinating process, adding pieces of apple, and brining the bird for a longer period to bring out more flavour in the chicken itself.
The shops were instant hits and inspired a bevy of copycats that helped define Nakatsu as the heart and soul of karaage.Moriyama was the first ever champion of the Karaage Grand Prix (Credit: Karaage festival ExCo)Today, chefs in Nakatsu have taken their karaage to the next level.
A healthy competition between the nearly 50 shops has inspired chefs to tinker with everything from cooking times and batters to a variety of soy- and salt-based marinades.
Nearly every shop in Nakatsu has a secret ingredient that they're not willing to share and which separates their karaage from the rest.Take Torishin, a shop run by Nakatsu's resident karaage shokunin (master) Shinichi Sumi, a five-time Grand Gold Award winner at the Karaage Grand Prix.
Sumi spent 15 years perfecting his karaage recipe.
Today, he cooks every part of the chicken at separate temperatures and his karaage is consistently rated the best in Nakatsu.For the perfect Kyushu Karaage Crawl, start out in Usa at Tenkatori run by Yasuhiro Fukuda who is the son of the original owner of Rairaiken – the first karaage shop in Kyushu.
From there, check out Chiemi, a woman-run shop helmed by Yoshimi Kanbara who has been making it out of her home for 43 years and only uses fresh oil.
From there, head to Nakatsu and eat at Torishin for a foodie's version, then check out Genkiya who specializes in chicken breasts, and finally make your way to Kokko-ya for a uniquely marinated bird that might just be the best of all.Then there's Takae Tateishi, one of the rare female karaage shop owners whose spot, Kokko-ya, is arguably the most unique in the city with her salt-rice-malt marinade and desire to do everything from scratch.
""What I can say with confidence is that I carefully remove the extra fat from the chicken.
I'm absolutely confident in how I prepare the meat,"" said Tateishi, whose chicken has a softer texture and spicier flavour that fires up your mouth.And then there's Kouji Moriyama, whose shop Moriyama was the first ever champion of the Karaage Grand Prix and is the nephew of Nakatsu karaage's founding father, Shoji Moriyama.
He makes a salt-based crispy karaage that erupts with juices from every bite and has a mix of undisclosed fruits that infuses his chicken with exceptional flavours.But karaage isn't just something to eat in Nakatsu, it's an entire identity.
Every autumn, there's Karafes, a karaage festival which attracts upwards of 50,000 people from around Japan and the world, and nearly every shop participates to drum up popularity for the city.
The town also holds a Guinness World Record for the largest serving of fried chicken topping out at 1,667.301kg (3,675lb, 12oz) that was set in 2019.Of those 40-plus shops in Nakatsu, everyone in the city has their personal favourite.
It reminds them of their childhood.
It's a food that rose out of poverty, fed a starving island and became a savoury symbol that can now be found at weddings, birthdays and major celebrations including Christmas when millions of Japanese eat fried chicken.
And the Karaage Grand Prix is their way to prove that this lineage makes their city the beating heart of fried chicken in Japan.The Karaage Grand Prix started in Tokyo in 2010 as a national competition to rank karaage and promote the tasty treat around the country.
Up until 2022, voting was entirely online and the most popular karaage shops typically won all the awards.
According to Kouichiro Yagi of the Japan Karaage Association, ""[in 2023] a taste test by the judges will be included to further improve the value of the awards.
""The judges will base their decisions on the frying colour, the batter, the harmony between the meat and the batter, the juiciness, the flavour, the cost effectiveness (how much you get for the price), and the temperature level (too much heat can cause burns).Karaage is fried chicken that has been lightly battered and marinated (Credit: zepp1969/Getty Images)When you talk to the shop owners in Nakatsu, they're borderline dismissive of the past competitions.
But you could tell they all felt that this year was different.
Shinichi Sumi of Torishin said, ""The next one is real.
I want the challenge and I'm going to try to win.
""The CEO of the Nakatsu Karaage Association, Masahiko Inoue, looks at the 2023 Grand Prix along with Nakatsu's place in the karaage world in an existential way.
""The next competition is important because people will know which shop is really number one.
But ultimately, I want everyone to know that Nakatsu karaage is special.
And that it is branded.
The same way certain wagyu beef is branded.
It's like a seal of approval that it comes from Nakatsu.
""Karaage represents perseverance, it shows ingenuity, and it's a reminder of how Japan overcame adversity.
And for the residents of Nakatsu, it's the soul food that simply feels like home.BBC.com's World's Table ""smashes the kitchen ceiling"" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.

travel,"Autumn leaves crackled under our shoes as dozens of eager tourists and I followed a guide along a grassy mound.
We stopped when we reached the opening of a turf-topped circle, which was formed by another wall of mounded earth.
We were at The Octagon, part of the Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks, a large network of hand-constructed hills spread throughout central and southern Ohio that were built as many as 2,000 years ago.
Indigenous people would come to The Octagon from hundreds of miles away, gathering regularly for shared rituals and worship.
""There was a sweat lodge or some kind of purification place there,"" said our guide Brad Lepper, the senior archaeologist for the Ohio History Connection's World Heritage Program (OHC), as he pointed to the circle.
I looked inside to see a perfectly manicured lawn – a putting green.
A tall flag marked a hole at its centre.
The Octagon is currently being used as a golf course.The Hopewell Culture created massive, mysterious earthworks across Ohio (Credit: Mary Salen/Getty Images)All of these all these prehistoric ceremonial earthworks in Ohio were created by what is now called the Hopewell Culture, a network of Native American societies that gathered from as far away as Montana and the Gulf of Mexico between roughly 100 BCE and 500 CE and were connected by a series of trade routes.
Their earthworks in Ohio consist of shapes – like circles, squares and octagons – that were often connected to each other.
Archaeologists are only now beginning to understand the sophistication of these engineering marvels.
Built with astonishing mathematical precision, as well as a complex astronomical alignment, these are the largest geometrical earthworks in the world that were not built as fortifications or defensive structures.
And while most people have never heard about the sites or its builders, that may be about to change.The US Department of the Interior has nominated eight of Hopewell's earthworks for consideration in 2023 as a Unesco World Heritage site.
These include The Great Circle and The Octagon in Newark, Ohio, as well Ohio's first state park, Fort Ancient (not an actual fort).
The other five are part of the Hopewell Culture National Historical Park: Mound City, Hopeton Earthworks, High Bank Works, Hopewell Mound Group and Seip Earthworks.
Lepper told me The Octagon and The Great Circle were once a larger, single Hopewell complex spanning 4.5 sq miles and connected by a series of roads lined by earthwork walls.
Walking through both sites today, there is an immediate shock of scale.
The Great Circle, where the museum for Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks is found, is 1,200ft in diameter.
Its walls rise up to 14ft high and are outlined on the inside by a deep ditch.
The Great Circle was once connected to a square and a burial ellipse, with only part of the square still visible today.
The Octagon sprawls a massive 50 acres and is attached to the 20-acre Observatory Circle, a large earthwork circle for gathering and rituals connected to the observation of the night sky.The earthworks' sophistication has astonished historians (Credit: Ohio History Connection)""You could put four Roman Colosseums inside just The Octagon,"" Lepper told me.
Stonehenge would fit within just that small circle now serving as a putting green.
He added that 2,000 years ago, indigenous workers built these earthworks without modern tools, digging up soil with pointed sticks and hauling it in wicker baskets on their backs.
One estimate, he noted, is that they moved seven million cubic feet of dirt.
The achievement of the Hopewell Culture, however, is not simply in creating large, precise shapes, which they did without the vantage point of hills for an aerial view.
They also embedded a sort of hidden geometry within these structures.
Until the mounds were measured and compared, it was thought that the builders didn't have any mathematical and geometrical sophistication, as there are no written records to testify to their level of knowledge.
It was eventually discovered, however, that they made precise measurements across their earthworks and connected them in unsuspecting ways.
Lepper explained that the circumference of The Great Circle ""is equal to the perimeter of the perfect square that it was connected to"", and that ""the area of that perfect square is equal to the area of the [Observatory Circle] that's connected to The Octagon"".
He added: ""If you draw a square inside The Octagon by drawing a line from alternate corners of The Octagon, the sides of that square [1,054ft] are equal to the diameter of the circle that it's attached to [1,054ft].
""Examples of the Hopewell Culture's monumental earthworks have been found all over Ohio, including at the Miamisburg Mound (Credit: Gary Whitton/Alamy)Examples of this interplay between earthworks have been found repeatedly by archaeologists.
According to Lepper, that measure of 1054ft, whether halved or doubled, is found in other indigenous earthworks across the country, and served as a common unit of measure.
While the Hopewell Culture's geometrical and mathematical knowledge astonished scholars, another level of sophistication appears when the layers are peeled back further: astronomical alignment.
In the 1980s, two professors at Earlham College in Indiana, Ray Hively (a physicist and astronomer) and Robert Horn (a philosopher), decided to pay a visit to The Octagon and its attached Observatory Circle.
As astronomical monuments like Stonehenge had received great attention, they wondered if these earthworks were also aligned to a solar calendar.
Hively and Horn found no solar connections, but they then considered an alternative purpose: the lunar cycle.In the 1800s, white settlers began building their homes around the areas where the earthworks were built (Credit: Quagga Media/Alamy)""We thought deliberate lunar alignments unlikely at Newark,"" they wrote, because while the Sun can be tracked over a year, a complete lunar cycle takes 18.6 years.
Even so, the lunar cycle proved to correspond to the position of the Observatory Mound at The Observatory Circle.
There, one can watch the Moon rise over the exact centre of The Octagon in the distance every 18.6 years.
""Astronomical alignments are only relevant and useful if they somehow tie the celestial orbs to belief systems and understandings of life,"" said Timothy Darvill, professor of archaeology at Bournemouth University who has researched both Stonehenge and the Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks.
""The ceremonies around the observation of the skyscape could well have a secondary function in terms of fostering community.""
That ancient community and culture is part of the case being made to Unesco.
A Unesco site needs to show that it has ""outstanding universal value"", said Jennifer Aultman, director of historic sites and museums at Ohio History Connection and the Ohio lead for Unesco consideration.
One criterion for this, she said, ""is that these are masterpieces of human creative genius"", which is where these mathematical, geometrical and astronomical features are important.
The other, ""is that they bear really exceptional testimony to the cultural tradition that produced them"".In recent years, the area near the Octagon has been used as a golf course (Credit: Brandon Withrow)Aultman explained: ""You really can understand something about the lives of the people and what mattered to them by looking at, and learning about, the earthworks.""
Consider the Moon, for example, which was clearly important for the Hopewell Culture.
Darvill told me that, for some cultures, the ""Sun, Moon... are considered to have power over what happens on a day-to-day basis.
As such, the heavenly bodies are often deified, which is how their power is justified and rationalised.""
It is therefore likely that the Moon was a deity shared by those who gathered at the mounds.
""The land we know as Ohio is home to a number of extraordinary earthworks built by indigenous residents of this region thousands of years ago,"" said Megan Wood, executive director and CEO of the Ohio History Connection.
While not all earthworks in Ohio are specifically Hopewell Mounds – such as the solar-aligned Serpent Mound Historical Site in Peebles, Ohio, for example – Wood sees them all as ""icons"" of indigenous ""cultural achievements"".
Since the Hopewell Culture left no written records, only the earthworks and the few objects retrieved from them serve as their last cultural testimony.
While archaeological excavations continue on some sites, objects like ritual smoking pipes and a small stone statue of a shaman wearing a bear skin and holding a human skull called ""the Shaman of Newark"" have been found.
As these earthworks were gathering places and not villages, artefacts representing the locations from where these indigenous peoples travelled have also been discovered, like effigy pipes, a copper head plate and an obsidian knife.Because they left no written records, the Hopewell remain something of a mystery to anthropologists (Credit: Caleb Hughes/Alamy)However, after the Hopewell Culture gradually began to disappear starting around 500 CE, other indigenous peoples stepped in to become caretakers of the land.
One of those groups was the Shawnee Tribe, which called Ohio home before they were forcibly removed west of the Mississippi River in the 1830s.
""We may not have been responsible for building or creating them, but I know that my ancestors lived there, and that my ancestors protected them and respected them,"" said Chief Glenna Wallace of the Eastern Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma, who believes that other tribes should have a role in the future of protecting the Hopewell Earthworks and communicating their cultural importance.
However, receiving Unesco status is a difficult, bureaucratic process.
While sitting on land owned by the OHC, The Octagon is under the control of the Moundbuilders Country Club.
The club negotiated an unprecedented lease that extends until 2078 and only allows visitors to walk the mounds four times a year.
The rest of the time, visitors can access a platform in the car park to view a very small section of the property.
OHC is currently suing to evict the country club (with compensation) through eminent domain.
The lower courts ruled in favour of the historical society, but the Ohio Supreme Court is hearing an appeal.
If OHC can't guarantee public access, this may impact Unesco's decision.A small public viewing platform allows visitors to see the mounds across the golf course (Credit: Brandon Withrow)While a Unesco designation wouldn't entail the return of land or reparations, it does mean greater local representation and education about Ohio's Native American history.
It also means more indigenous stakeholders, like the Shawnee, telling that story from an indigenous perspective for future generations.
""I just want people to know about it,"" said Chief Wallace, ""I want people to be able to see it.
I want people to be able to visit it and want people to realise that it is a cultural phenomenon.
That it's priceless.

travel,"Imagine long strands of dill swimming in a cold, beetroot soup; soul-restoring potato dumplings with your choice of cottage cheese or meat on a freezing winter's day; fried black bread with garlic you vigorously rub onto the bread yourself.
These are some of the staples of Lithuanian cuisine; hearty meat-and-potatoes fare to fill you up for the labour of the day.They're all delicious, comforting and satisfying, but that's only scratching the surface of Lithuanian cooking.
Tourists are forgiven for their ignorance since the tiny Baltic nation has yet, for better or worse, to tickle the imagination of travel and food media at large.The tragedy of it all is: Lithuanians themselves can be just as unaware when it comes to their own culinary heritage.
But there are a number of chefs committed to remembering their historical national dishes and serving it up so that future generations can continue the long process of reclaiming their cuisine.The fact that many Lithuanians are unfamiliar with the roots of their own cuisine was not by accident.
Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union from 1940-1990.
""It is very important to bear in mind that during the Soviet occupation, Lithuanians for nearly 50 years did not have access to their own history,"" explained Nida Degutiene, author of the book A Taste of Israel: From classic Litvak to modern Israeli.
(Litvak refers to Jews with roots in historical Lithuania.)
""Our history was rewritten by Russians.
Any religion – Catholic, Jewish – was forbidden.
""Degutiene explained that baptisms, church marriages and celebrating Shabbat were all forbidden during the Soviet era.
""People were hiding their identities,"" she said.
""We knew nearly nothing about the roots of our cuisine.
""Cold beetroot soup is a common Lithuanian dish (Credit: Kyoko Uchida/Alamy)Chef Rita Keršulytė-Ryčkova of Lokys in Vilnius puts it even more succinctly: ""The internal policy of the Soviet Union, especially in the Baltic region, was to erase our identity and make us Soviet, not Lithuanian.
""This meant spending more time on Russian language lessons than Lithuanian and ridding society of its intellectuals – applying the same approach to Lithuanian literature, culture, religion and gastronomy.
""There was a one-cuisine approach for our entire region without variation,"" Keršulytė-Ryčkova said.
""There was a list of dishes that were made in all restaurants and cafes, and you could not do anything out of the list.
""Keršulytė-Ryčkova said that a typical Soviet menu might include Chicken Kyiv (chicken fillet pounded, rolled in butter and coated with egg and breadcrumbs); shashlik (meat skewers); meatballs made from pork; goulash; and borscht.Two or three generations of gastronomic knowledge were lost by the time Lithuania gained independence from the Soviet Union on 11 March 1990.
Lithuanians had mistakenly conflated their historical cuisine with Soviet cuisine, and the knowledge of how to make traditional Lithuanian dishes was lost.
But chefs like Keršulytė-Ryčkova are resurrecting it, creating menus that tell a national story many Lithuanians themselves aren't familiar with.But where does this story begin?In Lithuania, there's a community of Romuva who continue to practice their ancient traditions.
They're some of the first who can recognise the ancient roots behind how many Lithuanians eat and drink today.In Lithuania, Romuva is making a comeback with approximately 10,000 members and an ongoing fight for state recognition.Ugnius Liogė, who organizes the community's annual Mėnuo Juodaragis festival, met me with Ignas Šatkauskas, a Romuva priest, at the snow-covered stone altar of Ragutis, the beer god of Lithuania's ancient faith.
The medium-sized boulder sits behind an encased ""eternal flame"" next to the Russian Orthodox Church of St. Paraskeva in Vilnius's well-preserved Old Town neighbourhood where it's believed the original altar once stood.Both Liogė and Šatkauskas discussed the violent period of Christianisation that occurred in the 14th Century, considered to be the most turbulent in Europe.
For many Lithuanian history buffs, this bit of historical trivia is seen as a kind of humble brag that Lithuania held onto their native traditions longer than others in Europe.
(Armenia was the first nation in the world to adopt Christianity in 301 CE followed by various European kingdoms between the 4th and 12th Centuries.
)Ultimately, however, Christianity became the dominant faith, but eating and drinking habits borne from this ancient tradition have remained, even if many Lithuanians don't know it.
Kūčios, for example, is the traditional Christmas Eve (or Winter Solstice) dinner with some roots in ancient Romuva practice that Christians adapted to celebrate the birth of Christ.
Although this practice was officially forbidden during the Soviet occupation, Catholic families continued to observe the tradition in secret.Lithuanian historian Andželika Laužikienė explained some of the specific rules and traditions tied to Kūčios.
For example, there are 12 dishes that represent the 12 apostles.
These contain no meat, milk products or eggs because it's a strict fasting period.
""One has to taste at least a piece of every dish,"" she said, ""for prosperity in the next year.
""Laužikienė added that Lithuanians draw straws of hay from underneath a piece of cloth to see if they're going to live long – a tradition with strong roots in the Romuva faith.Then there's raguolis, a traditional Lithuanian tree cake served on special occasions, particularly Christian holidays, like Christmas Eve and Easter.
It's a large cake with hollow rings that look like horns.
""Ragai"" means ""horns"" in Lithuanian, and it harks back to the ancient God, Ragutis.Raguolis is a traditional Lithuanian tree cake served on special occasions, particularly Christian holidays (Credit: MNStudio/Alamy)These are just a handful of the ancient Romuva traditions that live on.
You'd never know where they came from by observing with the naked eye given the way they're constantly recycling and taking new forms.
Nevertheless, they remain.None of this is to say that all of Lithuania's culinary heritage stems from ancient or medieval times.
There were centuries between the Christianisation of the country and Soviet occupation.
And with that period of relative freedom, there's plenty for contemporary chefs to rediscover.
According to Keršulytė-Ryčkova's research, Lithuanian-written recipes did not exist before the 19th Century.
And thus, she works with historical references to dishes and ingredients found in archives and old books, recreating them based solely on their description.
""We worked with the Lithuanian History Institute, and we looked into the inventories of different palaces,"" she said.
""So, you have ingredients listed for each century, for each period, for each duke.
""It was a busy Tuesday night when Keršulytė-Ryčkova led me down the spiralling stone staircase into the 16th-Century Gothic cellar where an entire portion of the menu features wild game with captions referencing the history.Wild boar, for example, was a privilege reserved for Lithuanian nobles.
Only they were permitted to hunt.
Commoners, on the other hand, risked a death sentence if caught hunting.
Now, for the price of €21, anyone can have a boar roast the likes of which Grand Duke Gediminas (1275-1341) would've enjoyed, served with cowberry wine sauce, and sweet pear and potato croquettes with cheese.
There's also a beaver meat stew with mushrooms, tomatoes and a potato puree flavoured with spinach.But what truly grabbed my attention, left my stomach grumbling and piqued my curiosity was the section of vegetarian and vegan dishes devoted exclusively to dishes with roots in Litvak cuisine: homemade boletus (a kind of mushroom) dumplings served with onion jam, cheese curd balls stewed in a tomato sauce; and zeppelins (a large potato dumpling also referred to as cepelinai) served with sour cream.
This Litvak vegetarian section is a relatively new addition to the menu.Cepelinai, or zeppelins, are large potato dumplings served with sour cream (Credit: Simon Reddy/Alamy)Keršulytė-Ryčkova explained that a Jewish-American man whose parents were Litvaks from Vilnius visited and quickly became upset after looking through the menu.
Lokys promised a recreation of historical Lithuanian cuisine and he couldn't find any representation of his ancestors.
Keršulytė called the interaction an eye-opening, moving experience.
She admitted her mistake and promised him that the next time he came, she would have a dish on the menu that represented his history.While not making excuses, Keršulytė-Ryčkova explained that this, too, is common in Lithuania.
The guilt of the Holocaust, she surmised, is probably why.
""We missed a big part of Lithuanian history, because in Lithuania, we do not talk about our Jewish community that used to live here,"" she explained.
""We know it, but it's not a subject we touch a lot commonly.
""To fill the Litvak gap, she referred largely to Vilnius' own Fania Lewando, who wrote The Vilna Vegetarian, first published in Yiddish in 1938 and rediscovered and translated into English in 2015.
The kosher caterer and author championed vegetarian cuisine long before it was en vogue and climate change demanded a tougher look at our eating norms.
Her work drew inspiration from Jewish values that discourage causing animals undue pain and continues to inspire a new generation of Jewish vegetarian cooks.
Keršulytė-Ryčkova based her curd cheese balls in tomato sauce on a mix of recipes from Lewando's book, such as the canned tomato soup, stewed potatoes with tomatoes, Ukrainian cheese varenikes (pierogis) and cheese dumplings with breadcrumbs.
The kneidlach (matzo balls) came to her from Nida Degutiene's recipe in A Taste of Israel.The term ""potato dumpling"" is a catch-all English translation of a wide variety of potato dishes in European cuisine.
In Vilnius, it'll get you a cepelinai or zeppelin – large dumplings made from grated raw potatoes and shaped by hand into the round, cylinder shape of a zeppelin.
They're more glutinous than gnocchi and a closer cousin to the German or Austrian Kartoffel Knödel.
It's soft and spongy with a generous dollop of dill-infused sour cream surrounding it like a castle moat.Keršulytė explained that the Litvak dishes on her menu are so inextricably intertwined with non-Jewish Lithuanian culture, that they've adapted them for Christian traditions.
The boletus or mushroom-stuffed dumplings are a Christmas Eve tradition.
""We also eat latkes, the potato pancakes that come from Litvak heritage,"" she said.This blending of cuisines likely happened when Lithuanian girls would work at Jewish tavernas and learn to cook, bringing new recipes back home with them.
Keršulytė-Ryčkova said this is how cepelinai entered and became the showpiece of Lithuania's culinary canon.
They're easy to make, filling and nourishing.
Non-Jewish Lithuanians merely adapted it by adding pork.Most Lithuanians would point to cepelinai as one of the staples of their cuisine along with other potato-rich dishes, like kugelis – oven-baked grated potatoes mixed with onions, milk, eggs, salt, pepper and bacon.
But Keršulytė-Ryčkova said they're actually from Vilnius' historical Litvak community dating to the beginning of the 17th Century.
""It's a very funny thing, because if you ask any Lithuanian on the street, he will swear that it's 100% Lithuanian and that it has nothing to do with the Jewish community,"" she said.
""But it did come from their Litvak cuisine to us.
""Fortunately, Lokys isn't the only restaurant where Litvak cuisine lives on.
There's Beigelių krautuvėlė (simply ""bagel shop"" in English) opened by cookbook author Dovilė Rūkaitė in 2016.
Inside there's a counter surrounded by the various caffeine-pumping apparatuses of a coffee shop and a bakery display with bagels, guoninė pynė (poppy seed rolls) and four golden bialys (like bagels but baked with a depressed centre filled with onion and poppyseeds).
There were also teiglach (fist-sized, knotted pastries) on the counter.Beigelių krautuvėlė sells fist-sized, knotted pastries called teiglach (Credit: Beigelių krautuvėlė)At dinner the night before, my cousin, Lina Daniene, who grew up in Vilnius absorbed by the Soviet Union, struggled to recall names of traditional Yiddish foods like these and told me that she regretted not learning how to make them from her grandmother.
""I think I was not encouraged to do so by my grandparents who feared anti-Semitism,"" she said.
""But maybe they simply did not see much value in passing down the traditions, and I was not too willing to learn.
I don't know.
""At Beigelių krautuvėlė the following day, I excitedly snapped a photo of the honey-coated teiglach with orange zest, and a surprising blast of ginger, and sent it to her for confirmation.""Wow!""
she replied within minutes.
""That's what I meant!
""Kugelis is a dish of oven-baked grated potatoes mixed with onions, milk, eggs, salt, pepper and bacon (Credit: Zoonar GmbH/Alamy)Degutiene said that it took leaving Lithuania in 2009 for Israel to learn that many dishes (like latkes, challah, blintzes and honey cake) were, in fact, just as Jewish as they were Lithuanian.
""It honestly took time for me to acknowledge that, indeed, this has been our common culinary heritage,"" she said.
Today, she thinks of Vilnius as one of the best places in the world to eat Jewish food.These Jewish dishes are just one piece of the Lithuanian culinary pie.
At Ertlio Namas, chef and co-founder Tomas Rimydis focuses on recreating Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque Lithuanian cuisine, interpreted with modern sensibilities in mind.
Seasonality serves as the foundation of the restaurant as he relies on what's available in the garden, what he can hunt in the woods or fish in nearby rivers and lakes.Rimydis admits that the first two years of Ertlio Namas were difficult given the Covid-19 pandemic and their unconventional menu, at least in the eyes of Lithuanians.Ertlio Namas's dining room is housed in a 17th-Century home in Vilnius (Credit: Ertlio Namas)""People didn't understand no potatoes and pork,"" he said.They struggled with 20% occupancy in those early years, attracting almost exclusively tourists.
Now, post-Covid lockdowns, Rimydis estimates that locals make up approximately 90% of their clientele with 100% occupancy almost every night.Dinner service is an event, housed in an intimately lit 17th-Century home with a curtain separating the entrance into the modestly sized dining area.
The waiter pulls the curtain back like an usher granting you entrance into the theatre.
The way waiters explain the history behind each dish feels like a moderately paced theatrical performance.The dishes start in the 15th Century (beetroot bread with roasted sunflower seeds) and work their way up to the 19th Century (quince dessert with chocolate and bread ice cream).
There's everything from wild game (for meat eaters) to beetroot soup, a puree of Jerusalem artichokes and the ever-popular honey cake inbetween.
A vegetarian adaptation was easy, considering the extra fasting (from meat) that Lithuanian dukes and nobles historically partook in.
This, our waiter explained, was to prove to the Pope how serious they were about their Catholicism.Chef Tomas Rimydis of Ertlio Namas focuses on recreating Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque Lithuanian cuisine with a modern interpretation (Credit: Ertlio Namas)A lesson on the contributions of Bona Sforza was a course unto itself.
The Italian-born Duchess of Bari became the Queen of Poland and Grand Duchess of Lithuania in 1518 through her marriage to Krakow-born Sigismund I the Old.
Our waiter explained that the queen was responsible for bringing 15th-Century Italian ingredients, such as tomatoes, cauliflower and artichokes, to the region in the days leading up to the Poland-Lithuanian commonwealth, forever leaving her mark on the cuisine – and therefore the menu at Ertlio Namas.
""If you come to Lithuania, you must come to Ertlio Namas,"" insisted Rimydis.
""Then you can hear the history and really understand Lithuanian cuisine.
""I travel often for food.
Few experiences have drastically altered my conception of a national cuisine as my time in Vilnius.
Don't let the facade of meat and potatoes fool you.
The fare is as rich and complex as what most of us love about Italian, Japanese or French cuisine.

travel,"The 6km journey from Benfleet railway station took me across a creek and along a busy main road into the town of Canvey Island, an expanse of low-lying, reclaimed land separated from the rest of Essex by a network of waterways and protected from tidal flooding by a serpentine seawall.
The fields soon disappeared from view, replaced by a semi-industrial sprawl dotted with retail parks, warehouses, factories and huge fuel storage tanks.A few vehicles turned off at the local golf course, the rest pulled into a large supermarket.
Other than a learner driver practising an emergency stop on a quiet stretch, no one else continued onto Northwick Road, where an empty car park with a blink-and-you-miss-it sign and a metal sculpture of an insect were the only indicators I'd reached a biological hotspot.Spanning some 93ha of meadows, grassland and scrub on the shores of Holehaven Creek, Canvey Wick has ""as many species per square metre... as there are in a rainforest,"" according to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), which manages the site in partnership with conservation charity Buglife on behalf of the Land Trust, which looks after public open spaces for the benefit of local communities.A metal sculpture of an insect marks the entrance to Canvey Wick (Credit: Sioned Jones)It's also one of the most significant areas in the UK for invertebrates – a category that includes insects, arachnids and molluscs, among others – with more than 1,500 species, 30 of which are on the UK's endangered ""red list"".
They include the evocatively named shrill carder bee, the five-banded weevil wasp and the scarce emerald damselfly.As I followed a trail into the 18.5ha Canvey Wick Nature Reserve, the drone of traffic was slowly replaced by rustling leaves and the sound of birdsong.
Apart from the occasional dog walker, there was no one else around, and while many of the wildflowers had largely disappeared for the year along with the insects that depend on them, autumn gave the area a stark, eerie beauty.
Although I was just 30 miles from central London, it felt like a wilderness.
""Canvey Wick is a hugely important place,"" said Jamie Robbins, Buglife's programmes manager.
""It's more than just invertebrates.
We've got loads of rare flowering plants like orchids.
There are birds like nightingales and whitethroats, and it's a real hotspot for reptiles such as common lizards, slow worms and adders.
""The origins of Canvey Wick's abundance of wildlife lie, unexpectedly, in the geopolitical turmoil of the Middle East of the 1970s.
Originally a grazing marsh, the site sits on the south-west edge of Canvey Island, which was sparsely populated by sheep farmers, salt harvesters, fishers and shellfish cultivators for some 2,000 years.
At the turn of the 20th Century, the island was home to just a few hundred people, but over the following decades the population surged as it became a fashionable seaside resort – until low-cost package holidays in Europe brought the good times to an end – as well as a centre for the petrochemical industry.Canvey Wick was once a centre for the petrochemical industry (Credit: Chillingworths/Getty Images)Canvey Wick, though, remained untouched until 1970, when Occidental Petroleum controversially secured permission to build a six-million-tonne oil refinery, storage depot and deep-water jetty on the site.
The US firm ploughed £55m into Canvey Wick, covering it with a 2-3m layer of silt, sand, gravel and shell fragments dredged from the River Thames to help prepare for the development.Yet work ground to a halt just a few years later thanks to the first ""energy crisis"" – when Middle Eastern countries slashed oil production in response to US support for Israel during the Yom Kippur War, triggering a global economic crisis – which made the project unviable.
Canvey Wick was, essentially, abandoned to nature.In the mid-1990s, many of the refinery's larger structures were eventually demolished, but plans to build housing, a business park and retail developments on the site came to nothing, thanks to campaigns by the local community.
This inaction provided the space for a remarkable transformation.
The dredged material was partially contaminated and created free-draining conditions, said Robbins, keeping the site largely open and stopping trees and dominant vegetation from establishing.
""You end up having this lovely mosaic of bare ground and flowery stuff, which invertebrates love.
Canvey Wick has the kind of habitats that have been lost in the wider landscape as Essex has become more agricultural, industrial and full of housing estates.
It's the last refuge for a lot of rare species.
""Today Canvey Wick is one of the most significant areas in the UK for invertebrates (Credit: Helen Cowles)Canvey Wick was named a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in 2005, with Dr Chris Gibson, an officer for government advisory body Natural England, memorably describing it as a ""brownfield rainforest"" (a brownfield site is land that was previously used for industrial purposes).
The designation protected the site – which was subsequently taken on by the Land Trust – from future developments.
After a period of habitat restoration work, the nature reserve opened to the public in 2014.
Since then, engaging the local community has been a vital part of the project.
According to Marc Outten, the RSPB's site manager for Canvey Wick: ""It's about making it accessible.
Canvey Wick lends itself to journeys of discovery and exploration.
""Jo Loman, Buglife's community warden for Canvey Wick, plays a key role in this process, organising a wide range of activities, including school holiday events, conservation programmes for young people and guided walks.
She also works with the National Health Service on ""social prescribing"", an approach that see doctors refer patients to non-clinical services to support their health and wellbeing.
""My job is to get the whole [community] to understand that Canvey Wick is there, that it's a unique place and that they should be really proud to have it on their doorstep,"" she said.
""I'm a big believer in education by stealth – doing fun activities, but people learn stuff while they're there.
""Visitors from further afield are also finding their way to Canvey Wick, thanks to the July 2022 launch of a new 85-mile stretch of the England Coast Path, which passes by the site.
""People have certain perceptions of what Essex is about, but I think opening up this path will really help to raise awareness of what the county has to offer,"" said Lisa Bone, tourism and place marketing manager at Visit Essex.
""[Canvey Wick] is a very special place in a very unusual setting.
It's a great asset for an area that needs a tourism boost.
""The derelict jetty that stretches across the creek now provides nesting spots for birds (Credit: Shafik Meghji)Stumbling across the remnants of the refinery today feels like discovering the ruins of a lost city.
I walked along roads that led nowhere, greenery lapping at their edges like an incoming tide.
There were rows of decapitated streetlights, and the last of the summer wildflowers burst out of giant concrete cylinders at erratic angles.
Meanwhile, the rusting niches of the biggest surviving structure, the deep-water jetty that marches out into the creek, provided nesting spots for birds.It was a vivid illustration of the dramatic change that can take place in semi-urban, post-industrial sites in a relatively short period of time, as well as the vital role these under-appreciated areas can play in tackling the biodiversity and climate crises.
This value isn't always recognised: Buglife is currently campaigning against a plan to build a theme park on Swanscombe Peninsula, a similar post-industrial urban wilderness on the Kent side of the Thames Estuary.
""Open, flower-rich grasslands are really important for biodiversity,"" said Robbins.
""When we think about [storing] carbon, a lot of people's brains go straight to trees, but well-managed grasslands and wildflower [landscapes] can store, in some scenarios, even more carbon than trees.
Brownfield sites like Canvey Wick often get a bad name but they have a huge amount to contribute.
""Although the site is just 30 miles from central London, it feels like a wilderness (Credit: Gordon Scammll/Alamy)The climate emergency felt close at hand on Canvey Island.
After exploring the nature reserve, I followed the towering seawall south to the Lobster Smack, a 17th-Century pub that features in Charles Dickens' Great Expectations and was once renowned for smuggling and bare-knuckle boxing.
Running along the south coast, the concrete barrier is a reminder that Canvey Island has always been threatened by the sea: 58 people were killed in a devastating flood in 1953.
The current defences may look formidable but will not protect the island as sea levels continue to rise due to climate change.
A government project is set to renew and improve the seawall so that it remains effective until 2070.The vulnerability of the island underscores the importance of sites such as Canvey Wick.
""Here we want to create an appreciation of the links between nature and our ability to survive on the planet and between biodiversity loss and climate change,"" said Outten.
""[The trick is to] get people interested in nature first – once they're interested, they'll want to protect it.""

travel,"The rich aroma of acarajé fritters sold by Baiana vendors mixed with the rhythmic drumming of Salvador's street bands.
Tourists and locals flooded the bars of the Pelourinho neighbourhood to watch Brazil's first game in the 2022 World Cup, and crowds erupted as they scored against Serbia.
This joyous celebration, set against the blue skies and pastel-coloured colonial-era buildings of the Terreiro de Jesus square, is typical of the capital of the Brazilian state of Bahia, Salvador de Bahia (better known as Salvador).
I quickly learned that celebration is the norm rather than the exception in Salvador, a city located along Brazil's north-eastern coast near some of the country's best beaches, which is considered by many to be the birthplace of modern Brazil.
Locals have a saying, ""Sem pressa, olha para o céu, fala com Deus, você tá na Bahia"" (Take your time, look at the sky, talk to God, you're in Bahia), which, as Salvador-born Alicé Nascimento points out, embodies the relaxed and feel-good atmosphere unique to this region.
It is no wonder then that this Unesco World Heritage city is unofficially known as Brazil's ""capital of happiness"".When you ask locals (known as Soteropolitanos) what makes Salvador so jubilant, they all seem to mention the same thing: axé, a Yoruba West African term that loosely translates to ""energy"".
Jair Dantas Dos Santos, a Salvador local, describes Salvador's axé as a ""powerful presence in the air, which is something to be felt rather than explained"".
Indeed, Soteropolitanos say axé is an energy woven into the fabric of Bahian culture, and it imbues everything from Salvador's music to its laid-back attitude towards life.It is impossible to describe Bahian axé without first considering the region's layered and tumultuous history.
Salvador was settled in 1549 by Portuguese colonialists and served as Portuguese America's first capital until 1763.
It was a major seaport during the transatlantic slave trade and is considered the New World's first slave market, with enslaved Africans brought to work on the region's sugar plantations.
Local teacher and poet Antônio Barreto says that to understand Salvador's complex history, you need look only at the name given to the city's historical centre: Pelourinho (pillory), the wooden device used to subject individuals to public abuse.
During colonial times, enslaved individuals were publicly punished on pelourinhos for alleged infractions.
Today, its name lingers on as a reminder of Salvador's dark past.
During the slave trade era, the Portuguese enslaved more Africans than any other country, transporting nearly five million of them to Brazil.
Most of these enslaved individuals came from Angola, another Portuguese colony, and other western African countries.
Slavery persisted in Brazil until 1888, yet Barreto explained that enslaved Africans and their descendants continued to fight for their freedom and traditions for many years.
The Bahian coat of arms illustrates the strength of its people through the Latin phrase ""Per ardua surgo"" (I rise through the difficulty).Today, Salvador is considered the Afro-Brazilian capital, with roughly 80% of residents tracing their roots to Africa.
The city's unique culture is a testament to the strength and courage of its people who relish the axé of the present and proudly celebrate their rich, Bahian traditions drawn from Portuguese, African and Amerindian peoples.
Walking through the streets, it is easy to see these diverse musical, culinary and religious practices melding together.Salvador is the Afro-Brazilian capital and was the country's first capital (Credit: Jan Sochor/Alamy)As Barreto and I strolled through the centre of Pelourinho, we approached the Terreiro de Jesus square, notable for its colonial-era churches and monuments dating to the 17th Century.
The blend of stucco buildings and African-inspired art found throughout the Terreiro de Jesus highlights the cultural fusion and resilience so unique to this city.
Once a place where enslaved Africans were beaten, the square now serves as the backdrop of Bahian festivals celebrating capoeira and samba, two practices born in Bahia.
In front of the São Francisco Church, notable for its golden-sculpted interior and illusionistic, Baroque-era painting, we stumbled upon an energized capoeira roda (circle) performed as part of the Festival de Cultural Popular, which celebrates Bahian traditions.
Capoeira performers moved fluidly to the beat of atabaque drums and the berimbau, a single-stringed, bow-shaped percussion instrument originating in western Africa.
Like the atabaque and the berimbau, capoeira also traces its roots to Africa.
Historians believe that capoeira, a unique blend of martial art and dance, was developed in Brazil by enslaved Africans as a means of self-defence under Portuguese control.
Today, capoeira is a staple of Salvador street entertainment and represents both liberation and freedom.
Practitioners say their agile movements embody the spirit of vadiação, which loosely translates to loitering, and exemplifies the region's easy-going energy.Across the Terreiro de Jesus, Barreto and I found a samba performance, where the dancers' movements synchronised to the beat of guitars, drums and pandeiros (tambourines).
Like capoeira, samba was born in Bahia by enslaved Africans and is now considered Brazil's national dance.
Different forms of samba developed throughout Brazil during the colonial era, with the Samba de Roda hailing from Salvador.
This form is a collective performance combining dancing, musical instruments, singing and poetry drawn from both African and Portuguese traditions.
Today, samba is danced widely throughout Brazil, with Salvador's Balé Folclórica da Bahia home to professional performances celebrating the Bahian-born dance.Samba and capoeira were both born in Bahia and developed by enslaved Africans (Credit: Kate Schoenbach)Bahian traditions like capoeira and samba are celebrated with great regional pride.
In fact, Salvador's main festive season, which runs from December to March, begins with Samba Day and ends with Carnaval.
Locals are quick to point out that the world's largest Carnaval street parties are found not in Rio, but here in Salvador.
Perhaps nothing embodies the concept of axé more than Candomblé, a syncretic religion that blends Yoruba and other West African traditions with Roman Catholicism.
Ask Soteropolitanos and they'll quickly tell you they're happier than other Brazilians because they have more festas (celebrations) than other regions, due largely to the strong presence of the Candomblé faith, and if you wander through Salvador today, you're likely to see Candomblé practitioners offering blessings to passersby.The Candomblé faith developed in Brazil during the colonial era when the Portuguese forced Catholicism upon enslaved Africans.
In an attempt to preserve their spiritual identity, enslaved peoples blended the likeness of Catholic saints with their own African orixás (spirits).
While Candomblé is now generally accepted in Brazilian society, practitioners, unfortunately, still face occasional discrimination.
However, in Salvador, both Catholic churches and Candomblé terreiros (temples) coexist in relative harmony, with Candomblé's presence felt strongly throughout the city.
Candomblé's influence is particularly evident in the resplendent dress worn proudly by the Baiana de Acarajé women selling traditional street food.
Their vibrant attire is emblematic of Candomblé and highlights the blended traditions of the region's diverse population.
While Baiana outfits are inspired both by European Baroque-era dress and Yoruba-style clothing, their multicoloured beaded necklaces represent Candomblé orixás.
Salvador's streets are filled with Baiana women selling things like African-inspired acarajé (a fritter made of black-eyed peas) and cocada (a coconut dessert), while joyfully sharing their culture with both locals and tourists alike.Like its religion and dance, Salvador's food is heavily influenced by its African roots and is meant to be celebrated (Credit: Kate Schoenbach)In Salvador, food – like life in general – is meant to be celebrated.
Popular local dishes like acarajé and abará (a snack similar to acrajé that is steamed in a banana leaf) are offered to Candomblé orixás during ceremonial festivities and are imbued with axé by local worshippers.
Outside Candomblé holidays, the city's thriving restaurant scene and vibrant markets are a great way to experience Salvador's unique cuisine throughout the year.
While exploring the bustling Ladeira da Preguiça neighbourhood, I met local cook Cris Oliveira de Santana, who described her favourite dish, abará, as an ""explosion of flavour that's a mixture of both Brazil and Africa"".
Like other traditions borne out of Bahia, Oliveira de Santana said Bahian food not only constitutes local identity but represents the ""berço do Brasil"", or birthplace of modern-day Brazil itself.From its blended arts to its fusion food, Salvador's traditions embody a historical resilience and cultural pride inextricably linked to the city's celebratory axé of life.
Perhaps Salvador's real key to happiness lies in its ability to transform its tumultuous history into a unique type of joy that Salvador has given to the rest of Brazil.--- Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called ""The Essential List"".

travel,"The road to Kjeåsen, a mountain farm deep in western Norway's fjord country, looks like a route to nowhere.Hugging the shoreline of Simadalfjord, a tiny arm of Hardangerfjord, the road wanders from the village of Eidfjord past wooden waterside cabins and oxblood-red farm buildings.
It rarely sees any traffic, which is just as well because the margin for error is measured in inches: one lapse in concentration and you'll be in the water.Up ahead, the outlook for a road trip is not promising.
Sheer rock walls, so steep that they keep the valley floor in shadow for months every year, close the Simadalen valley off from the rest of the world on three sides.
Where the fjord ends, the road passes through forests of pine and spruce, crosses a rushing stream fed by waterfalls and then arrives at a fork.
Turn right and the road soon peters out in the forest, its onward path blocked by rock walls hundreds of metres high.
Turn left in the direction of Kjeåsen and the journey seems equally unpromising for want of any obvious way forward.I am travelling this road because my destination is no ordinary place.
Kjeåsen sits 600 vertical metres above Simadalfjord, and its small collection of farm buildings is famous throughout Norway as one of the most isolated inhabited corners of the country.
For most of its long history, there wasn't even a road up to where it sits, perched on a narrow grassy ledge, hidden from the outside world but in thrall of one of the country's most spectacular views.It was only in 1975 that the farm was connected by road to the rest of the world nearly 600m below (Credit: Heidi Kvamsdal)Back then, it was one of the most difficult, most beautiful places to reach anywhere in Norway.
To get to Kjeåsen involved a perilous, two-hour climb, using rope ladders and rope bridges across a landscape slickened with ice.
There were once as many as 13 children at Kjeåsen, and their daily commute to the school in Simadal was a dangerous four-hour round trip.
Access was so difficult that one of the buildings still extant at Kjeåsen took 30 years to build, back at the end of the 19th Century, because supplies had to be carried up the dangerous mountain trail on the backs of the builders.To have lived there by choice, cut off from the world, must have been a conscious act of escape or of solitude.
From where I am, down below, where Kjeåsen is just a name on a road sign, it's impossible to imagine.
In fact, it's easy to wonder whether Kjeåsen exists at all.There are many theories about the first people to settle here.
""One is that it was a soldier who deserted from the Swedish army,"" said Heidi Kvamsdal, a photographer, local historian and Eidfjord native.
""Another theory is that the first ones tried to escape from the Black Death [in the 14th Century]"".
In its aftermath, said Kvamsdal, people abandoned Kjeåsen for more than 150 years.
But ""we know that there has been permanent settlement there since early 16th Century.
""News of Kjeåsen first reached a fascinated outside world in the 1950s when Swedish writer Bror Ekström visited and wrote a book called Folket på Kjeåsen (People of Kjeåsen).
The book told the story of a farm community, unique and tiny, of a world unto itself; of mountain families cut off from the outside world, yet somehow surviving against the elements.
It was a story that juxtaposed inaccessibility with miraculous beauty.
And their stories of isolation and resilience captured the public's imagination.The farm complex is now empty for most of the year, with the last permanent resident leaving in 2019 (Credit: Adonis Villanueva/Alamy)In 1967, a woman named Bjørg Wiik moved to Kjeåsen to help her aunt look after the farm, and she was joined by her sister Guri in 1975 when their aunt passed away.
The two sisters, formerly from Oslo, lived here alone until Guri's death in 1999.
Bjørg lived here year-round until 2019, when she was in her 90s, and she still returns with family members to pass the summer.The 8km access road was not finished until 1975.
But the road did nothing to diminish Kjeåsen's mystique.
Instead, it was like an open invitation for the curious.
Elin Kvale, a local guide who arrived in Eidfjord in 1975 when her husband worked on the road's construction, would later take the first tourists to Kjeåsen.
She remembers how ""all kinds of people came; some in wheelchairs, some very old, even people who were blind.
They all had a common goal: they needed to visit this place.
Most of the people had read the book, some several times.
They felt like they were walking on holy ground.
""Despite the road, Guri and Bjørg never learned how to drive – they preferred to walk or, if they needed supplies, they asked friends down in the valley to come up.
In any case, even a road was no match for the depths of a Norwegian winter.
As recently as 1994, the sisters were cut off from the outside world for more than a month by 3m-deep snow.
Provided they had planned carefully and stockpiled sufficient supplies, the snows were less of a problem than the strong, icy winds that can rage at these altitudes: to this day, the roofs of all the farm buildings here are held in place by anchored steel cables.
And on one occasion when the sisters fell ill with influenza while cut off by snows, a helicopter had to airdrop medicine and food to the stricken inhabitants.Due to the narrowness of the road, vehicles may only travel in each direction once an hour (Credit: Heidi Kvamsdal)Autumn was always Bjørg's favourite season at Kjeåsen, says Kvale, and when I begin my own drive up here on a cold and cloudy November morning, the road appears deserted.
But before I begin, I have to wait.
The road is so narrow that a one-way system operates: cars driving up to Kjeåsen must do so on the hour; those descending leave half an hour later.As the clock ticks over, with not another vehicle in sight, I turn onto the Kjeåsen road and begin to climb.
Beneath towering cliffs, the road cuts a sinuous path, hairpin bend after hairpin bend, switchback after switchback, gaining altitude all the while.
This part of the road is only 2.5km long, but already the valley is far down below.Up above, there is suddenly nowhere for the road to go, and so it plunges into a tunnel hewn roughly from the rock, climbing through the inner chambers of the mountain.
The tunnel is just 2.5km long, but it seems longer due to the knowledge that this dark corridor through a mountain is all that connects Kjeåsen to the outside world.As I emerge into the light, it takes a few moments for my eyes to adjust.
Clouds swirl through the treetops.
A mountain river thunders down off great boulders.
There are no signs of life.Kjeåsen became famous in the 1950s due to a book called Folket på Kjeåsen (Credit: Visit Hardangerfjord)Kjeåsen's tight gathering of wooden huts with stone foundations is as deserted as the road.
Above the huts, the hillside climbs steeply into the cloud forest.
Down below, narrow grassy fields, where Bjørg and her sister kept sheep and grew some of their own food, drop steeply down to a shelf from where… the view!For a moment, the clouds part and a near-perfect tableau of Norway's fjord country extends out across waters turned turquoise in the sunshine.
Impossibly steep rock walls rise into the snows and there is a distant glimpse of Eidfjord.
For a moment, I wish that I could live up here on the heights of Kjeåsen and sit for hours on end to gaze with wonder upon this, one of the most beautiful views in Norway.And then the clouds close in again, as they often do outside the short summer window.
The view is gone and I am alone here, cut off from world which suddenly feels a very long way away.
I shudder.
But there is a wild charm to the isolation, a delicious sensation of being beyond the world and its noise and having this special place all to myself.For the first time, I understand that, for those who lived here, the isolation was never the enemy and was only rarely an inconvenience.
In fact, remoteness was the whole point, a precious way of life that depended on a closeness to nature and seclusion from the wider world.
""Most of the winters were just good days,"" said Kvale, who knew the Wiik sisters well.
""They cared for the sheep, and for all the birds and other wild animals.
""In winter, bad weather can cut off the farm for weeks at a time (Credit: Anthony Ham)And in summer, their lives were the envy of those down below by the fjord: ""In Eidfjord, the soil was not so fertile, and the sun stayed away for months at a time,"" said Kvale.
""Kjeåsen has the sun whole year, the soil is more fertile, and it was much closer to the reindeer.
That was essential to their life support, as was the fish in the mountain lakes.
""It was, Bjørg once told Kvale, ""Easy to dream while sitting outside the house on a nice sunny day in autumn.
The air is so crystal clear.
Complete peace.
""On her frequent visits to spend time with Bjørg in her home, Kvale remembers there was ""a very special atmosphere of calm and peace"".
About once a year, Bjørg visited her childhood home in Oslo.
""But after a few days, she longed to return to the peace and good life at Kjeåsen.
Bjørg said often that Kjeåsen was her paradise.

travel,"The palace looked like a mirage of itself.
Water from the canal shimmered under the sun, directing my gaze towards it.
The opulent building commanded the landscape, and the landscape seemed made for it.
I hopped on my bike.
Beams of light strobed through narrow cracks between the trees and my tyres crushed the gravel.
As I cycled along a hidden path, crimson tree leaves canopied overhead and open fields sprawled into the distance.
There was no one in sight.
But just a short distance away inside The Palace of Versailles' opulent ballrooms, thousands of people swarmed.I was at the Park of Versailles, the 800-hectare playground for the kings, queens and political leaders who made up France's pre-Revolutionary ruling class.
Versailles was the centre of power and the material embodiment of absolute monarchy that reigned over France until the Revolution from 1788-1799.
The palace bore witness to strategic marriages and state visits.
But the whole estate was really constructed for another reason: leisure, with the sweeping park and smaller manicured gardens used for pleasure – and debauchery.The Park of Versailles is a sweeping oasis that is free to the public most days (Credit: Lily Radziemski)In the centuries since it was built, Versailles has become one of the most famous and visited palaces in the world – a site that sees 27,000 visitors and their selfie sticks crammed into its Hall of Mirrors every day.
But outside the palace there's another story, a sprawling one that extends for kilometres and is nearly impossible to cover by foot in a day.
That's where the bike paths come in, lining the way to fresh air, solitude and a side to Louis XIV's grand vision that few visitors grasp.
""When you go to the gardens, you're cycling... and you get to know more of the story of Louis XIV, XV and XVI,"" Mara Alfaro Prias, a Paris-based tour guide, told me over the phone.
""It's not just what was behind the paintings or the chandeliers.
""It all started in 1623 when Louis XIII built a hunting lodge in the rolling countryside around the small town of Versailles, about 20km south-west of central Paris.
But his son, Louis XIV, had bigger plans for the grounds.
""Louis XIV was a bit of an architect,"" explained Mathieu da Vinha, the scientific director of the Research Centre of the Palace of Versailles.
""In Paris he couldn't really enlarge the palaces because the urban tissue was too dense… in Versailles, it was the contrary.
""Louis XIV wanted an opulent ""bachelor pad"" where he could party with his royal pals (Credit: Lily Radziemski)But the king didn't just want more space.
""Louis XIV needed what we would call today a 'bachelor pad' – that is to say, a small house of pleasures… for fun parties with some friends,"" said Michel Vergé-Franceschi, co-author of the book Une Histoire Érotique de Versailles.
""So, he'll create Versailles, partially for his pleasure, for his sexuality, with amazing gardens.""
Near the top of the park's Grand Canal, tucked away between cafes and restaurants, there's a stand where visitors can hire bikes.
In recent years, I've made biking in Versailles my primary fresh-air escape from my home in Paris (a friend used to bike all the way from Paris to Versailles and inspired me), but I had never ventured much beyond the canal.
So this autumn, I strolled through the gardens on my way down to the bike stand, walking past the Latona Fountain, kicking up orange-hued leaves fallen from sculpted trees.
I wanted to discover more about the gardens overflowing with flowers and romantic groves.This was the vision of André Le Nôtre, the gardener to the king.One of the best ways to explore the grounds is by hiring a bike (Credit: Lily Radziemski)""It's a garden where nothing is left to chance,"" Hélène Dalifard, the palace's communications director, told me.
""The gaze is always guided toward a particular effect… the idea is really to imagine the garden as a museum in which the visitor thinks they're taking a random stroll, while in reality they're completely guided by the effects of perspective.""
The dimensions of Versailles and its park were carefully calculated to mirror the Louvre; the Etoile Royale (the vantage point at the far end of the canal) and the Fountain of Apollo are the exact same distance apart as the Place de l'Êtoile and the Place de la Concorde in Paris.
And the distance between the Fountain of Apollo and the Versailles Palace is the same as the distance from Place de la Concorde to the Louvre.
There are optical illusions, hidden groves and subtle messages alluding to the sun throughout the park.
When he became king, Louis XIV chose the sun as his personal symbol, and became known as the Sun King.
To reinforce that connection, the image of Apollo, the Greek god of the sun, appears in fountains, groves and statues throughout the park.
Symbolically, Versailles would revolve around him, and the gardens were his stage.
""Versailles was the king's theatre,"" Vergé-Franceschi, said, adding that Louis XIV even wrote a book about the correct way to visit the gardens.
The route, starting from the top steps of the garden, reads almost as a how-to manual, with precise directions on where to walk, pause and what to admire along the way.Louis XIV even wrote a guidebook about how to best visit his gardens (Credit: Christophe Coat/Alamy)The bike paths are framed by trees stretching overhead.
Dirt trails unlocked a whole other network of grassy expansions as the path gave way to Apollo's Fountain.
As I cycled, it felt like being in the middle of nowhere, despite the palace being one of the most visited places on Earth.
In 1661, when Louis XIV was married to Maria Theresa of Austria, he met Louise de La Vallière, the woman that would become his first official mistress.
""She would go horseback riding in the park… she could stand on a horse by holding the reins of the animal with silk cords, and she could kill a wild boar in the forest of Versailles with stakes,"" Vergé-Franceschi said.
They met in private, in Louis XIII's hunting lodge in the park.
The Party of the Delights of the Enchanted Island, a legendary blowout that stretched on for multiple days in the park and gardens, was officially to honour Louis XIV's mother and wife.
Unofficially, it was dedicated to Louise de la Vallière.
There were carousels, fireworks and performances by renowned French playwright Molière.An estimated 27,000 visitors and their selfie sticks cram into Versailles' Hall of Mirrors every day (Credit: Stockbym/Alamy)""Since the chateau was too small before Louis XIV enlarged it, the parties mostly took place in the gardens,"" da Vinha said.
The park has an air of excess and exclusivity, but surprisingly, the grounds were traditionally never closed to the public.
The entire complex remained open, from the king's bedroom (as long as he wasn't there) to the gardens and the park.
Today, Versailles still always remains open to the public, and access to the gardens and park is free, except during select days.
""The tradition of the French monarchy is that the king should be accessible by his subjects, so one could enter into the chateau pretty freely under the condition of being well-dressed,"" da Vinha explained.
The lack of privacy could have been a contributing factor to the expansion of the grounds.
In Versailles, one palace just wasn't enough.The Grand Trianon is just a five-minute pedal from the bike stand (Credit: Lily Radziemski)Louis XIV wanted an escape from his escape, and commissioned the Grand Trianon on the northern end of the Grand Canal in 1670.
This was where he spent time with Madame de Montespan, the mistress who followed Louise de La Vallière.It's a 30-minute walk from the palace to the site, but a bike path cuts directly to it in a five-minute ride from the rental stand.
The gravel route travels between the Grand Trianon and the canal, wrapping around the water.
The structure sits on an elevated piece of land, its salmon-pink marble walls bending into archways open to the landscape.
It's breezy and pretty, like a little jewel box born out of nowhere.
When I went towards the end of the day, there were few others roaming through its rooms.A short pedal away from the Grand Trianon lies the Petit Trianon, a palace Louis XV commissioned for the Comptesse du Barry in 1758, his mistress at the time (it was supposed to be for Madame de Pompadour, but she died before its completion).
It would eventually be offered to Marie-Antoinette as a gift from Louis XVI in 1774.
She spent most of her time there.
The isolation of the monarchy at Versailles played a role in the Revolution; they continued to live in opulence while the French population was starving, and hundreds of citizens ultimately stormed the grounds in 1789.
""Versailles contributed to [Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette] being disconnected from reality,"" Vergé-Franceschi said.Today, the palace and park are part of the Republic (Credit: Only France/Alamy)A few years after the Revolution, the palace and its gardens were absorbed by the Republic, to be conserved for the public.I dropped off my bike, and left the park at sunset.
There were no lanterns illuminating the roads and pathways, just stretches of darkness, the palace lights barely visible in the distance.
When the sun goes down, the complex closes its gates, leaving the Sun King's maze of fountains, groves and bike paths in solitude – until tomorrow.Slowcomotion is a BBC Travel series that celebrates slow, self-propelled travel and invites readers to get outside and reconnect with the world in a safe and sustainable way.

travel,"From the moment the heavy bronze doors swing open, inviting you in from a rough, post-industrial street to a dark space filled with wonders, the experience of entering Copenhagen's two Michelin-starred restaurant Alchemist is like falling down a rabbit hole.In the luxurious lounge where guests are served their first few courses, a window to the kitchen-laboratory illuminates jars of ingredients on the back wall.
Then you are whisked to a domed space where plastic bags dance like jellyfish in the ""ocean"" above you, and a further 40 or so head-spinningly strange mouthfuls of food arrive.A buttery lobster claw that lingers on the palate.
Herbs arranged in the shape of Danish fairy tale writer Hans Christian Andersen's profile that dissolves when soup is poured over them.
A wonderfully round snowball that, when you bite into it, tastes of a ripe tomato.
A silicone spoon in the shape of a tongue that you have to lick to discover its gooseberry and pumpkin seed flavours.
A raw Faroese sea urchin blended with foie gras to produce a texture like silk.As a drink containing bioluminescence extracted from jellyfish is served, the lights are dimmed, allowing it to glow.Beyond creating a surreal experience for the privileged few who can dine here – menus cost 4600 DKK (£538) per head excluding drinks, and tickets, released three months ahead, sell out in seconds – head chef Rasmus Munk has bigger fish to fry.
It's not enough for him to create a double-Michelin starred restaurant featuring on The World's 50 Best Restaurants list; he wants to change how we think about food.Alchemist is located in the former set building workshop of the Royal Danish Theatre (Credit: Søren Gammelmark)""It's about changing the world through gastronomy and using gastronomy as a platform,"" he said.
""We want people to be more affected by the work that we do, and we really nerd into the storytelling and the presentation to do that.
""The dishes include ""hunger"", where thin silver ribs are draped with sustainable rabbit meat, making its well-heeled diners squirm in their seats as they think about starvation; a blood drop-shaped ice cream served with a QR code that links to an organ donor scheme, and a chicken foot presented in a cage the exact proportions of a factory-farmed chicken's cage, while the domed ceiling fills with a video of metal cages clanging down on top of each other.Other dishes touch on sustainability and biodiversity: the Faroese sea urchin is an invasive species that strips underwater vegetation making eating them an act of environmental protection; a nettle butterfly dish was developed after the research team realised the potential of farming the protein-rich insects.
It's more than theatre: since 2020, nearly 13,000 guests have used the organ donation QR code (without access to the end websites, the restaurant can't assess how many have actually signed up).
""Hunger"", thin silver ribs draped with sustainable rabbit meat (Credit: Claes Bech Poulsen)The genesis of the idea of a fine dining restaurant that goes far beyond the classic constellation of white tablecloths, waiters, diners and chefs began when Rasmus was a chef in Jutland.
His culinary career took him on a more conventional route until a volunteering project gave him an epiphany.
""I got a buzz from making Christmas dinner for a group of disadvantaged kids one year,"" he said.
""It made me think: there's more to food than cooking something that tastes great.
""He set up his first Alchemist restaurant in a different location in Copenhagen in 2015, fast establishing himself as a chef who thinks outside the box by serving dishes including an edible ash tray dish inspired by lung cancer.
While other regional chefs at this level were following the established New Nordic pattern, he wanted to include art, science and society in an approach he calls ""Holistic Cuisine"", encompassing everything from how you treat your staff and suppliers to how you design a restaurant.Chef Rasmus Munk wants to change how we think about food (Credit: Søren Gammelmark)That means his staff work a 48-hour week, unheard of in the fine dining business, with weekends off and a four-day work week; they also get a pension plan and healthcare.
On the payroll alongside chefs, the restaurant has a composer, performance artists and 3D animators; completing the holistic approach, diners are greeted by actors and dancers and leave via a ball pit.Rasmus' creative thinking attracted the attention of billionaire financier Lars Seier Christensen, allowing him to open his current restaurant in 2019 in the former set building workshop of the Royal Danish Theatre.
It was awarded two Michelin stars seven months later.
When legendary Spanish chef Ferran Adrià visited, he described it as one of the most memorable meals he has had in the last 10 years.A precision focus combined with an open mind fuels this thinking.
Beyond the main kitchen, where 24 chefs scrape chicken feet, prepare plump miniature bao buns and ready the restaurant for evening service, the research team, led by Diego Prado, develops new ingredients and experimental foods of the future.
""Burnout Chicken"", a chicken foot presented in a cage (Credit: Søren Gammelmark)""We make the building blocks in order for the test kitchen to make interesting and new dishes,"" Diego said.
""And that means finding new ingredients, new techniques and making it all possible for the test kitchen.
""Recently that has meant refining silkworm silk to create a protein that can be spun into a light meringue, persuading silkworm farmers to collect silkworm frass (excrement) to be brewed into tea, making yoghurt with ants, and running tests on butterflies to understand how seasonality affects their flavour.Beside Diego, PhD researcher Nabila Rodriguez Valerón is working on a project to take the bitterness out of vegetables, inspired by the Japanese taste-sensation of kokumi.Kombucha flower on Alchemist's taste wall (Credit: Søren Gammelmark)""It's super interesting to develop different products and foods like this,"" she said.
""I think this is a good tool to drive a healthy diet, especially for kids, as a way to introduce vegetables into their diets.
Because nobody really like steamed broccoli, do they?""
Other collaborations with researchers at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) focus on developing sustainable food from seaweed and fungi, breaking down different kinds of materials to create something new.
""We have been pushing the boundaries of what people can eat a lot.
These things might end up in a dish, but it's not the goal,"" said Diego.
""And right now, we are also working more and more with projects that are not really related to the restaurant.""
One of these projects has been a collaboration with a researcher at MIT's Media Lab about space food, where teams have been experimenting with moon soil, and sending miso into space to test fermentation as a possible process to help feed future space-dwellers.Alchemist's research team develops new ingredients and experimental foods of the future (Credit: Claes Bech Poulsen)Diego also speaks to suppliers and farmers about the parts of their produce that they don't use and don't sell, in a bid to create food from what is otherwise destined to be waste.
The approach has resulted in plenty of dishes to date, and a cocktail named the ""Fur Martini"" with ingredients including rabbit ears.Perhaps the most exciting thing to come out of the kitchen is not on a plate at all, but the use of its knowledge and holistic approach to food to help society.
During the pandemic, Rasmus used Alchemist's kitchens to feed Copenhagen's homeless through his JunkFood non-profit organisation.
Alchemist has also collaborated with the children's ward of the local Rigshospitalet hospital, helping children on the cancer ward.The restaurant created an app to help them choose food, introduced new food technology into the hospital kitchen, and created a protein-rich ice cream for children recovering from cancer, when that is all they want to eat.
They are currently contributing to the future experience of Mary Elizabeth's Hospital as specialist advisors where, subject to funding, a pilot project will work towards creating world-class hospital food.In Alchemist's main kitchen, chefs prep dishes for evening service (Credit: Søren Gammelmark)As Emilie Vagner, anthropologist and project manager on the user experience team at Mary Elizabeth's explains, Rasmus' unique holistic approach to food is what makes it work.
""That's why we wanted to work with him: it's not just about taste and food, but about surroundings too.
We have children here with no appetite so getting them motivated to eat is important.
His holistic approach understands that.
""""We believe it will change everything: there are so many knock-on effects,"" said Rasmus.
""Less medicine, less time on the ward, and more happiness, of course, too.
And then after five years, we can go out with results and hopefully spread it out with more hospitals in Denmark and maybe the world.
""It's about creating impact beyond the plate.
For me, I'm thinking: what is the next step for us to really make an impact?
That's what we'll do next.

travel,"On my final morning in Hydra, I woke up early and ambled down to the waterside to watch the weekly deliveries.
Docked at the stone harbour walls was a barge that brings over islanders' orders from the mainland.
Patiently queuing to board the boat were several donkeys.
Groups of three or four would climb aboard then return a few minutes later bearing household items, packages and even bags of cement in woven baskets strapped to their backs.
The donkey drivers – all moustachioed island men – quickly led their charges away up alleys leading off the port and out of sight.Hydra's archaic reliance on donkeys for transport stems from a 1950s presidential decree that is intended to preserve the Greek island's architecture and character.
It includes a rule that wheeled vehicles – cars, motorbikes and even bicycles – cannot be used there.
Since the town is built on steep, amphitheatre-like hills rising from its horseshoe-shaped harbour, donkeys are the only form of transport that can climb the steep steps and narrow alleyways up to many residents' homes.Municipalities around the world are currently looking at ways to reduce reliance on private cars, or even ban them from certain parts of a city altogether.
Indeed, the London borough I live in has recently introduced a ""low traffic neighbourhood"", a scheme that uses number-plate recognition cameras to restrict through-traffic so only residents can drive there.
So, towards the end of an island-hopping holiday through the Greek islands, I was intrigued to see what a place that had never permitted cars was like.Donkeys are the only method for transporting goods up town's steep hills and alleys (Credit: Molly Dailide)On first impressions, car-free island life felt idyllic.
In towns on other Greek islands, I'd found myself regularly pressed up against walls on pavement-less roads to let mopeds buzz by.
In Hydra, by contrast, I could wander around at my own pace, gawping at pink bougainvillea cascading down whitewashed walls, citrus and pomegranate trees in gardens and pretty squares framed by red pantile-roofed buildings.Despite the presidential decree, visitors to the island may occasionally see a handful of vehicles, including a town rubbish truck.
And while forbidden for adults, bicycles are allowed for children up to the age of 12 – but they can only be ridden in the winter months and not during the tourist-heavy summer.It was also remarkably quiet; none of the screeching brakes or roaring engines typical of towns and cities elsewhere.
Occasionally I heard a donkey honking or church bells clattering, but otherwise silence reigned.The town also felt very human in scale.
Walking up the maze of narrow streets and alleys to get a view over the harbour, I frequently saw groups of friends and neighbours greeting one another, chatting and gossiping in the middle of the road.
One evening a group of kids ran past my table as I drank a beer by the port, bashing each other with balloons, their parents with no anxiety about traffic.
Even the countless stray cats, a familiar feature of Greek islands, seemed unusually relaxed – often sprawling out lazily in the middle of thoroughfares.I'm hardly the first outsider to be enchanted by Hydra, which has a long history of tourism and has also attracted a bohemian set.
Canadian songwriter Leonard Cohen famously bought a house here in the 1960s and penned Bird on a Wire during one of his stays.
Dina Adamopoulou, who works at Hydra's historical archives, told me several painters including Picasso, Chagall and countless Greek artists have also paid visits.Hydra is known for its peace and quiet, something that has long attracted tourists (Credit: Anton Petrus/Getty Images)For tourists like me, the fact that Hydra is car-free makes it a lovely place to visit.
But what about the roughly 3,000 people who actually live here?
How does a place work in the modern world without wheeled transport?
""We regularly catch fire,"" said Kelsey Edwards, an Englishwoman who's lived on Hydra for more than 20 years and runs HydraDirect, a local information and property website.
""Every summer, fire planes have to come over from the mainland and dump water on wildfires.""
Edwards explained that since much of the island is inaccessible due its lack of roads, the local firefighting volunteer groups are unable to put out conflagrations on their own.
Even when blazes break out near Hydra town itself, which is the only significant population centre, ""everyone has to run and manually carry up water to put the fire out"".And fires aren't the only time where a lack of vehicles is a hindrance.
""We can't just dial [emergency services] and get an ambulance,"" Edwards continued.
She said that when people have health emergencies, getting to the town's small medical centre can be very difficult, especially for those who live higher up the steep sides of the hills.
Often, people need to be brought down by stretcher or on the back of a donkey to get seen by medics, which Edwards said can feel rather undignified.Hydra's car ban stems from a 1950s presidential decree to preserve the island's architecture and character (Credit: Freeartist/Getty Images)I also spoke to Rebecca Eptakili, the manager at my hotel, who has lived in Hydra for the past 38 years.
""My husband is a carpenter,"" she told me.
""One evening a few years ago he cut his fingers off by accident at work.""
The local medical centre simply wasn't equipped for such a severe injury and, since it was after dark, it was not possible for a hospital helicopter to fly from Athens.
So, Eptakili's husband needed to wait for a sea taxi to take him the 30 minutes to the closest point on the mainland, then get another 1.5-hour taxi to the capital.Besides emergencies, there are a lot of daily inconveniences that come with living in a place where vehicles aren't allowed.
Edwards pointed out that taking household waste to the few collection points that the town's rubbish truck can reach is a headache.
Getting things delivered is a pain too, and the costs of transporting building materials is exorbitant.
Meanwhile, Eptakili noted that frailer people who live higher up in the town often end up isolated; it's not easy for wheelchair users to get about either.Still, on balance, Edwards reckons that most Hydriots would stick to the status quo if pushed.
""You only have to say to the local people: let's pick you up, let's put you on Spetses [a nearby island] where you can't walk along the street or go around a corner without being run over by somebody on their annoying scooters and motorbikes and quadbikes and breathe the air that's thick with the smell of petrol, and say 'should we do that on here?'
And they go: 'no, no, we don't want that!'.
""Hand carts are another popular means of transport on the island (Credit: Molly Dailide)The fact there are no cars is, in many ways, a big driver of the island's economy.
Hydra is only about 90 minutes by boat from the busy metropolitan sprawl of Athens, yet it feels a world away.
Tourists come precisely because it's so peaceful.
Hydra is also much wealthier than other islands in the Saronic archipelago to which it belongs, Edwards said.
This is, at least in part, driven by the fact that outsiders like how quiet it is.By never permitting motorised vehicles, Hydra has avoided many of the challenges facing other small islands in the country.
Kosmas Anagnostopoulos, founder of CIVINET, a sustainable transport network, told me about the various problems that vehicles introduce on small Greek islands.
""You have a lot of severe accidents on the islands, especially the very touristic islands like Mykonos, Santorini, Paros and Naxos,"" which mainly involve tourists who don't understand the local road networks.Building car parks to store all the vehicles is also difficult on Greek islands due to the country's ancient history.
Anagnostopoulos explained that councils struggle to build underground parking since there's such a high chance of digging up archaeological ruins, which then prevents further work.During my travels around other islands, it was noticeable how congested they could get – and I was travelling in the low season.
In summer, when tourists vastly outnumber the permanent population, cars and scooters strain the infrastructure to its limits, Anagnostopoulos said.Visiting Hydra feels a bit like stepping back in time (Credit: Sky Armstrong/Getty Images)Mimicking Hydra, and going vehicle-free, might not be a realistic option for other islands of a similar size.
Nonetheless, Anagnostopoulos said that several islands are being used as testbeds to find ways to reduce reliance on personal vehicles.The island of Kos has invested heavily in cycle lanes, he said; Aegina has banned cars from its harbour during the evening; and in Tinos, the municipality is running a scheme with battery-powered tuk-tuks.
Some islands have entered partnerships with transport companies, too.
For instance, Volkswagen is running a scheme on the island of Astypalea to provide shared electric car and bus transport.
That said, Kosmas noted many islands simply lack the funds to implement bold transport plans.Earlier on in my visit to Hydra, I'd headed west out of the town along the cobblestone ""road"" that hugs the coast.
It eventually fizzled out into a quiet track, where the incense of pine lingered in the air and the only sound was the pleasant buzz of cicadas and swish of the sea.

travel,"Located 100 miles west of Denver, the Colorado ski town of Vail is set in a bowl-like valley beneath the surrounding mountains, with cobblestone streets and overflowing flower boxes that wouldn't look out of place in an Alpine village.
Today, the town's slopes attract hundreds of thousands of skiers every year to what many consider to be the US' quintessential ski resort.
But few know that were it not for veterans of a World War Two mountain warfare division, this town – and many others like it across the country – may never have existed.
It all started with a meeting in a Vermont ski lodge.
In 1938, Charles Minot ""Minnie"" Dole founded the National Ski Patrol (NSP) to provide emergency rescue and medical care on remote slopes.
The following year, Dole watched as outnumbered Finnish troops on skis humiliated the Soviet army in eastern Finland during the so-called Winter War at the onset of WW2.
Fearing that the Nazis (who already had three mountain combat units) may invade the snowy Northeastern US through Canada, Dole lobbied the US War Department to create a unit equipped to fight in harsh, wintery terrain.
In 1943, the US Army established the 10th Mountain Division: the US' only combat unit dedicated to alpine warfare.
The War Department recruited the NSP to help train the new unit.
In addition to recruiting professional mountaineers and skiers from the NSP's ranks, the division attracted non-traditional soldiers, including champion skiers from New England colleges and ex-athletes with no ski experience who took up the fight against the Nazis.The 10th Mountain Division was created by the US War Department to help prevent a Nazi invasion and trained outside Vail (Credit: Vail Resorts)The division soon moved to a new training facility called Camp Hale, located 40 miles south of what is now Vail.
The camp was perched close to 9,000ft above sea level on rocky terrain that would prepare the nearly 19,000 soldiers for any potential battles ahead.
According to McKay Jenkins, author of The Last Ridge: The Epic Story of America's First Mountain Soldiers and the Assault on Hitler's Europe, soldiers practiced downhill ski runs, spent hours cross-country skiing and embarked on multi-day hikes through the high-altitude setting as part of their training.The Nazi invasion on US soil never came, but as the war continued, the 10th Division travelled to Italy's steep Apennine Mountains in 1945, where soldiers used their training to combat Germans stationed atop the jagged peaks.
Each soldier wore a white camouflage suit and carried a 45- to 55-pound pack filled with provisions, attaching their skis to their packs when not in use.
The Germans' mountaintop, sniper-armed fortifications gave them a clear advantage, but the 10th Division scouted five routes up the mountain, with each company taking a different trail.
While the 10th Division expected to see 90% losses, not a single man died during the nearly vertical climb up Riva Ridge, a steep incline overlooking Mount Belvedere.
Thanks to their training, the troops were able to glide up the snow and ice on skis in the middle of the night, taking the Germans by surprise and pushing them back with support from riflemen who accompanied them up the ridge, following their unofficial motto of ""sempre avanti"" (always forward).The Battle of Riva Ridge helped take the US take the important Axis encampment near Mount Belvedere.
But as the Germans carried out a counterattack after US soldiers skied and climbed up the mountain, 213 American soldiers were killed and another 782 wounded from the 10th Division and the supporting infantry divisions.
By the end of the war, the 10th Mountain Division suffered one of the worst losses of any group, losing nearly 1,000 of its nearly 19,000 soldiers.
Yet, their overall impact in WW2 was significant.The unit played a very important role in a battle against Nazi forces in Italy (Credit: Vail Resorts)""It actually opened up the Italian Campaign [the Allied plan to break up the Axis troops in the Apennine Mountains] to push through and end the war that much quicker,"" said Jeff Wiles, the guest services manager at Vail Resort.
Following the end of the war a few months after the battle, many of the division's veterans settled back in the US' few ski towns.
Among them was Pete Seibert, who joined the unit in 1943 as an 18-year-old.
He was wounded in the war and was told he wouldn't walk again, but went on to place third in a national slalom competition.
In 1957, while Seibert was working at Loveland Ski Resort, located between Vail and Denver, a friend took him on a hike along what seemed like the perfect ski slope.
Seibert's visit sparked an idea, and he soon met with people to buy up land and turn it into a resort in 1960.
They called it Vail.
""[The few] other ski towns [had an existing infrastructure], like Aspen, Crested Butte, Telluride.
They were mining towns that then became ski mountains,"" said Mason.
""[In Vail], there was not even a single road, not a single street.
There was nothing.
So, it's pretty incredible what he built.""
Seibert and other 10th Division alumni founded more than 60 ski resorts across the US (Credit: Vail Resorts)Seibert was in good company in the newly formed resort town.
After earning a Purple Heart (one of the US' highest military honours) in Italy, fellow 10th Division soldier William R ""Sarge"" Brown joined the burgeoning team, installing Vail's first snowmaking equipment in 1970.
""Every other person that you met, some guy that owned a ski shop, the bar, everybody.
Everybody was a 10th Mountain guy back in the day, especially in Vail, because there they could get in on the ground because [the resort] was so new,"" said Jennifer Mason, executive director of the Colorado Snowsports Museum, which has exhibits on the 10th Mountain Division and Vail's history.In fact, one of the most enduring legacies of the division's veterans is how they helped popularise skiing in the US.
In addition to Vail, former members of the 10th Division founded or were affiliated with some 60-odd ski resorts across the US, including Stratton, Whiteface and Aspen.
This helped create a post-war ski boom that opened the previously elite sport to a broader demographic, as the division's alumni created ski schools and educational programming throughout the country.
Clif Taylor, another 10th Division veteran wounded at Riva Ridge, designed shorter skis that made it easier for beginners to learn the sport, and soon Army surplus stores were selling thousands of pairs of skis at lower prices than their competitors.The division's other alumni also founded outdoor gear brands like Gore-Tex, Vibram and Outdoor Research, creating backpacks, tents and other gear based on their cold-weather experiences in Italy.
Another, Bill Bowerman, co-founded Nike.
These men also summited K2; gave other brands feedback to develop more lightweight skis; and founded the National Outdoor Leadership School, a global wilderness organisation.
In 1985, the division was reinstated at Fort Drum in New York, and served in Afghanistan, but its ""home"" is still in the hills surrounding Vail.
Today, Vail continues to honour its WW2 past with Legacy Weekends, statues and runs named after the division (Credit: Vail Resorts)Today, Vail is now arguably the US' most famous ski resort, and Seibert remained at the helm of it until 1977.
But the connection with the 10th Mountain Division continues to this day, with the resort celebrating its 60th anniversary in December 2022.
A statue of a soldier in the division's trademark white camouflage was dedicated in Vail Village in 1997, and a whiskey distillery in the town was named in honour of the division in 2016.
On the slopes, runs like Riva Ridge and Minnie's Mile are nods to the unit.
The 10th restaurant, located halfway up the mountain, honours the soldiers via a series of informational panels with QR codes that educate skiers on Vail's WW2 connections.
The resort also has a Legacy Weekend every February, which is centred around the anniversary of the Battle of Riva Ridge, with the landing of a Black Hawk helicopter and a torch-lit ski parade.
The parades continue seasonally through the Friday Legacy Days, when skiers don white jumpsuits like the men of the 10th Mountain Division wore in Italy, as well as World War Two-era skis, replica rifles and helmets.
Division veteran Fritz Benedict also created the 10th Mountain Hut Association, a series of backcountry huts for hikers, skiers and snowshoers to stay in, built with funds donated by veterans and in memorial of those killed in action, inspired by the ones found in the Alps.
""Those huts are very much emulated from the huts that are all over Europe.
There's about 13 of them and you could essentially ski from Vail to Aspen, and stay in a hut every night,"" said Mason.Skiing may never have become as popular in the US as it is today were it not for these WW2 soldiers (Credit: Patrick Orton/Getty Images)Five of the huts are within the recently formed Camp Hale National Monument, where the soldiers trained.
The site is made up of 53,804 acres, including what remains of the bunkers where soldiers slept during training.
Visitors can explore more than 80 miles of hiking trails and take part in backcountry skiing and camping; and a granite monolith at Tennessee Pass above the camp bears the names of the division's fallen soldiers.Today, skiers of all experience levels soar to the top of Vail Mountain in gondolas and shoot down slopes named for the people and places that birthed this resort.
But were it not for the skills learned in a nearby camp and a dangerous, dark climb up a distant peak into Nazi territory, skiing may never have become as popular in the US as it is today.

travel,"Every summer, in preparation for the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, Hasidic rabbis from all over the world travel to the northern part of Italy's Calabria region to handpick the best citron fruits for their lulav, the bundle of four plants used to bless the small, temporary huts built every autumn by Jews to celebrate the holiday.
For about two weeks, the orchards around the town of Santa Maria del Cedro fill up with English, Russian, Hebrew and Yiddish-speaking rabbis and their families.
With the help of local farmers, they inspect the trees and analyse the fruits, sometimes with magnifying glasses, in their quest for citron perfection.The most ancient and aromatic of all citrus fruits, citrons are far less known than their renowned yellow and orange cousins.
They resemble large, green lemons, have more peel than pulp, and with a sour-bitter flavour, they are not considered desirable for home consumption.
This means that, outside of Calabria, you won't typically find them at the supermarket.But according to the Torah, the etrog (Hebrew for ""citron"") is the ""fruit of the most beautiful tree"", possibly even the forbidden fruit of the Garden of Eden.
And although there are multiple citron varieties around the world, one Jewish community believes that the Calabrian one, known as Liscio Diamante, is the purest and most perfect of all.Each summer, Hasidic rabbis travel to Calabria to select the best citrons for the Jewish holiday of Sukkot (Credit: Alberto Pizzoli/AFP/Getty Images)The citron plant (Citrus medica) arrived in this region around 2,000 years ago, following Jewish migrations.
According to Helena Attlee, author of The Land Where Lemons Grow: The Story of Italy and Its Citrus Fruit, citron was the only citrus species to grow in Europe until oranges arrived 900 years later, brought across North Africa to Spain by the Moors.
The Jews were expelled from Calabria (and all of southern Italy) in 1541, but their connection with Calabrian citron farmers lives on to this day and remains crucial to the fruit's survival.
""It is only thanks to Chabad Jews if this plant still grows here,"" Attlee wrote.Chabad Jews are one of the largest Hasidic Jewish groups in the world, and their link to Calabrian citrons dates to the 1800s, when the group's founder, Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi, told his followers to prefer Calabrian citrons over all the others.
In a story he once told, the founder explained that when God instructed Moses to go look for citrons to commemorate the 40 years in the desert that had just passed, he sent messengers around the world and they came back with Calabrian fruits.
Since the 1960s, Rabbi Moshe Lazar, who is based in Milan, personally oversees the process of choosing them.With more peel than pulp and with a sour-bitter flavour, citrons are far less known than other citrus fruits (Credit: Aldo Pavan/Getty Images)""Summer has been a special time for as long as I can remember, as that's when the rabbis come to visit,"" said Angelo Adduci, who grew up in a family of citron farmers in Santa Maria del Cedro.
""These visits are familiar memories not just for me, but for everyone in town, and Rabbi Lazar is like an uncle to me.
It's a part of our childhood, and a happy one.
""Today, Adduci is president of the Calabrian citron farmers' union (Consorzio del Cedro di Calabria), which promotes the fruit and connects it to the region's many natural attractions.
The contrast of mountains and sea is one of the area's most distinctive features.When I drove to Calabria from northern Italy, I was struck by the fact that in some places, such as the town of San Nicola Arcella, the mountains on my left extended all the way to the sea on my right to form scenic cliffs, sea caves and arches.
These imposing mountains, which are part of the Pollino National Park, are a popular destination for hikers and rafters and are home to rare animal and plant species.
But squeezed between those mountains and the sea is a strip of farmland where the citron plants grow.
This area is called the Riviera dei Cedri (Citron Riviera), and for good reason.Citrons are often used to make candied fruits, which are sold in supermarkets around Italy (Credit: ChiccoDodiFC/Getty Images)""[Here] the warm breeze from the sea meets the cold wind from the mountains, and these two winds balance out in the middle, creating the perfect climate for citrons,"" Adduci explained.In general, citrons are mostly used to make candied fruits, confectionery, marmalades, sauces for meat and fish dishes, as well as cedrata, a popular Italian soft drink.
In Santa Maria del Cedro, the hub of citron growing, visitors will find specialised citron ice cream shops, bars serving citron cocktails, a citron festival, stores selling citron oil, and even a citron museum, the Museo del Cedro, which recounts the fruit's history through sensory and olfactory activities.
The fruit's sweet-yet-lemony scent also lends itself to citron perfumes.When she first visited Calabria, Noemi Disegni, president of the Union of Italian Jewish Communities, found all of this very surprising: ""As a Jew, I've always associated citron solely with the Sukkot festival, but there's a whole universe around this mysterious fruit.
It has its own cuisine and recipe books, and it comes as the sole ingredient in a range of food products, and even cosmetics.
I had absolutely no idea,"" she said.Citron growing is intensive work and remains an extremely niche industry (Credit: Eugenio Magurno - Giovanni Carnevale/Consorzio del Cedro di Calabria)Despite the large-scale production of soft drinks and candied fruits, which end up on supermarket shelves around Italy, citron growing remains extremely niche and is mainly carried out on small family farms or gardens.
""That's because the trees are very vulnerable, and they need lots of care and experience.
A wind stronger than average, or a sudden temperature change can destroy the year's harvest,"" Adduci explained.
""And even if the climate here is ideal for citron farming, these plants would not stand a chance without the knowledge of the farmers.
""After a visit to the Museo del Cedro and a tour of the orchards, head to Opificio Calabria in Santa Maria del Cedro for chocolate-covered citron treats or panicelli (raisins and candied citron wrapped in citron leaves.Stock up on citron liquor at Liquoreria Italiana in Praia a Mare, while at the Terre del Lao oil mill you'll find citron-scented olive oil, made by pressing olives and citron peel together.For a citron-inspired meal in the countryside, check out agriturismo Bonicose in Orso Marso (you can stay the night here, too)Taking care of citrons is a labour of love.
The delicate trees need regular pruning and protection with nets when necessary.
Farmers must always make sure the leaves get enough light and air, but also that the fruits are not exposed to direct sun, which might stain their skin, and that the tree doesn't damage its own fruits with its growing branches, leaves or thorns.
Also, Adduci explained, ""since the plants are small, farmers have to kneel on the ground in order to take care of them.
This also adds a Catholic dimension to it all, because it's a bit like praying.
As we say, it's a desperate fruit with an incomparable scent.
""If citron growing seems like intensive work, the production of kosher citrons adds an extra layer of complexity.
To be certified as kosher, or pure, the etrog needs to come from an ungrafted plant.
Cultivating ungrafted plants means giving them lots of extra attention and time as they are more vulnerable to disease, but it also keeps the variety pure throughout generations because there's no genetic mixing with other plants, which scientists say may happen when plants are grafted.Once a citron tree is declared kosher, the rabbinical inspection continues on each fruit, following precise rules.
The perfect fruit should weigh about 80g, have perfectly smooth skin (no spots or bumps or parasites) and must be neither too round nor too long.
The chosen etrogs are then placed in boxes and packed for shipping to Israel, Europe, Russia and the US.The Museo del Cedro is located in the town of Santa Maria del Cedro (Credit: Eugenio Magurno - Giovanni Carnevale/Consorzio del Cedro di Calabria)Last October, on the first day of Sukkot, when I opened the white etrog box I'd bought in Berlin from a Chabad rabbi, the citron inside was still perfect.
After three months, it hadn't lost any of its marvellous scent.
By autumn, the Calabrian farmers are already preparing for the next season, but, Adduci said, ""we feel incredibly proud to know that our fruits have reached the homes of hundreds of families around the world.
""Today the Riviera dei Cedri continues to live up to its name, with many small businesses offering the fruit in creative ways.
Visitors to the region can even go on citron tours called La Via del Cedro, which include visits to the orchards, nature walks, tastings and strolls around the ancient Jewish quarters.
""Although there are no Jewish communities left in Calabria today, Italy's Jewish world is proud of this cultural connection,"" said Disegni.
These towns' Jewish past, just like citron, runs deep through the cultural identity of north-western Calabria.CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly named Menachem Mendel Schneerson as the founder of the Chabad movement.

worklife,"The idea of a four-day workweek used to be such a pipedream that it was barely on the radar for most workers and firms.
But in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, many companies around the world have given this this set-up a go – and gathered promising results.In the US and Ireland, a six-month trial among 33 volunteer companies in 2022 showed a positive impact on company performance, productivity and employee wellbeing.
Employees working the shortened week reported less stress and fatigue, plus improved work-life balance and satisfaction.
The 27 companies that submitted a final survey rated the trial a nine out of 10.In a 2022 UK trial of 70 firms, 86% of companies said the four-day week was such a success, they planned to keep it in place after the pilot ended.
They cited benefits such as increased productivity and significant financial savings for employees on transport and childcare.
Similar trials in Belgium, Spain, Japan, Australia and New Zealand have thrown up equally promising results for companies.
And – unsurprisingly – employees seem especially keen to make shorter working weeks the norm.Yet despite the overwhelmingly positive data, a four-day workweek still seems out of reach for many workers.
Tech workers in agile, forward-thinking companies might hope for such a benefit in the near future, but it is harder to envisage the same change for schoolteachers or office workers in more traditional companies.
Ultimately, some industries and deeply entrenched work cultures mean the four-day workweek may not be realistic for all employees – at least for now.Finding the right fitTechnology and office-based industries have made the greatest inroads into reducing work hours so far.
“It is really taking off as a notable trend in areas like tech, software, ICT [internet communication technology], finance and professional services – knowledge-based roles that used to be primarily office-based, but are now in many cases are hybrid or remote,” says Joe O’Connor, director and co-founder of the Work Time Reduction Center of Excellence, based in Toronto.
While a mindset of agility and innovation is often baked into such companies, they also have an advantage in terms of easy, time-saving solutions.
Measures such as introducing meeting-free days can enable employees to focus purely on productivity and radically reduce work hours, while concurrently maintaining output – something far easier to do in nimble organisations.In other sectors, shortening the working week is possible, but requires re-thinking long-established norms.
Consulting and law, for instance, are often organised around the concept of the billable hour – meaning less work automatically equals less income.
But such cultures can change, believes O’Connor: “We're starting to see examples of law firms moving to four-day weeks by switching from billing by the hour to billing by project value, or by reducing their non-billable overheads so that their teams are more focused on client work.” The viability of this shortened workweek for companies in these less-flexible industries may also look different than what other, more nimble firms and sectors are able to do.For instance, “if [these firms] close on Friday and give everyone the same day off, that makes coordination with clients, suppliers and the rest of the economy harder”, says Pedro Gomes, author of Friday is the new Saturday, and coordinator of an upcoming Portuguese government trial of the four-day workweek.
“The alternative is to give different people different days off, so you maintain working five days, but then you need communication processes in teams to be able to deal with days when colleagues are not there.” As such, while collaborative workplaces like advertising agencies might choose for all employees to take the same day off to better enable team coordination, industries that rely on trade throughout the week, like hospitality and service, may establish processes for salaried, non-shift workers to take off different days.
In this way, many experts believe the four-day workweek can adapt to suit most industries.
“We have seen very successful examples everywhere,” adds O’Connor, “from non-profits to manufacturing companies, to even hospitality.”Some experts believe there are industries, such as manufacturing, that may have a more difficult time pivoting to a shortened workweek (Credit: Getty Images)Entrenched culture In the current workplace, some important predictors of whether an organisation is likely to successfully implement a shorter working week may be company size and culture.
So far, few major international companies have run trials of the four-day workweek.Despite positive results from a trial by Microsoft in Japan and Unilever in New Zealand, other major corporations have been slow to follow suit.
“Large companies have the financial capacity to make the change, but much more rigid structures,” says Gomes.
“In practice, what we see is more small- and medium companies trialling the four-day workweek because they are more agile, and they usually have a CEO or a founder that has a very good picture of how it would impact the whole business.”In other words, leaders of smaller firms may have less red tape to deal with, and find it easier to forecast how widespread change will impact the company overall than leaders in sprawling global organisations with more labyrinthian, layered structures.
But in companies of all sizes, a certain type of manager could also be resistant changing entrenched norms – a significant barrier to the implantation of shorter weeks.
Although the global movement in support of the four-day week is gathering pace, it is not yet a mainstream work practice, and undertaking such progressive change requires a high level of trust between leaders and workers.
If managers don't trust that employees can make a success of the change, they are unlikely to want to even test it.
(Notably, productivity-related trust issues have been a major problem for managers throughout the pandemic.)
“The biggest barrier to companies introducing four-day workweeks is likely a combination of entrenched culture and resistant bosses,” says Benjamin Laker, professor at Henley Business School, in Reading, UK.
“Some managers may view the shorter workweek as reducing their control, or making it more difficult to manage employees.” In other words, risk-averse managers might question why they would shake up a system that’s already working.In cases where four-day workweeks have proven unpopular among employees, a common issue has been reports of managers intensifying performance measurement, monitoring and productivity pressures.
So, although many workers cite better wellbeing in some areas, the result of these added elements can spike worker stress levels.
“If an organisation culturally doesn't have that trust but instead has a very top down, centralised decision-making structure, they would probably struggle to make this work,” adds O’Connor.Other organisations for which four-day workweeks are likely off the table are hourly- and service-based – like restaurants, retail and healthcare – where a shorter workweek and subsequently fewer shifts ultimately means lower compensation.
Although workers in these industries would likely experience similar benefits from reduced workloads, creating a pathway to less labour may be impossible, if it means losing out on pay.The new normalEven facing resistance from some leaders, experts say it is likely the four-day week will become more mainstream.
In sectors that are already welcoming the shift, the 32-hour week is emerging as “a as a tool for competitive advantage in terms of talent, attraction and retention”, says O’Connor.
“You could see a scenario in tech where by 2026, not offering a four-day week is almost a competitive disadvantage.”And the more companies that make the switch, the more others who have not yet made the move may feel pressure to do so.
“It’s hard to implement a four-day week when the rest of the economy is organized in a five-day week,” says Gomes, “but the moment you have the job market coordinating on a four-day week, then it forces the rest of the economy.” Even so, such widespread societal change would take “many years”, he says, and some industries will inevitably be left until last.
Schools, for example, might struggle to implement a four-day week for full-time staff unless parents were already working such arrangements en masse.There is also the possibility that companies will turn to other less drastic measures than a four-day week.
“I predict that no-meeting days, flexible work hours and other innovative approaches to work-life balance will become standard practice in the near future,” says Laker.For now, the shorter workweek may not be widespread, but there’s momentum around the globe to keep the experiment going.
In 2023, trials of the four-day workweek are planned or ongoing in Australia, Spain, Scotland and more.“There's an element of ‘the genie’s out of the bottle’.
We're not going back to the way we were working pre-pandemic,” says O’Connor.
“The four-day week is not going to be 100% of the economy, much like the five-day week is not wholly representative of the economy now, but it certainly could become the new normal.”

worklife,"Last week, Jacinda Ardern announced she would be standing down from office as New Zealand’s Prime Minister.
The 42-year-old, whose more than five-year term was marked by her handling of the aftermath of the country’s worst ever mass shooting, a deadly volcanic eruption and the Covid-19 pandemic, said on 19 January that she no longer had enough “in the tank” to do her job justice.“Politicians are human.
We give all that we can, for as long as we can, and then it’s time,” she said.
“And for me, it’s time.”Though Ardern, who also gave birth while in office, didn’t explicitly refer to burnout as the reason for her decision to quit politics, the public and media have widely interpreted her resignation speech as a reference to it.
Many have praised her as one of the first high-profile political leaders to admit to the toll of overwork that comes with the responsibility of running a country – something particularly notable, considering her reputation for remaining unflappable in the face of a tumultuous period in New Zealand’s history.
Some have also raised the prospect of Ardern’s candour on the topic representing a turning point, of sorts; a collective re-defining of burnout as something that is a serious ­– even potentially life-threatening – syndrome, and not just a personality trait of gritless millennials, or a lifestyle choice of overachievers.
Now, many people hope her words particularly might be a significant step towards normalising discussing mental health and work: a sign that discussions around burnout can be held without fear or perception of stigma, which in turn would allow employers to establish mechanisms to support employees before it’s too late.
Yet not everyone is so optimistic, especially for women.‘Occupational phenomenon’Burnout is broadly defined as physical and emotional exhaustion, coupled with decreased motivation and lowered performance at work.
According to the American Psychological Association (APA), it “results from performing at a high level until stress and tension, especially from extreme and prolonged physical or mental exertion or an overburdening workload, take their toll”.
In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) included burnout in its International Classification of Diseases and defined it as an “occupational phenomenon” (while also maintaining it is not a medical condition).Burnout has traditionally been associated with executives in industries like law, consulting and finance, where a culture of presenteeism has historically prevailed, often leading to extraordinarily long hours and overwork.
However, it’s increasingly affecting different generational cohorts, especially young people, and is manifesting across an array of sectors.Writing in Harvard Business Review, author and time-management coach Elizabeth Grace Saunders describes burnout as generally driven by factors including an excessive workload, a perceived lack of control and the sense that the time and effort put into a job are not commensurate with the rewards offered.Crucially, burnout is not a gendered condition ­­– it can affect anyone.
Indeed, during the pandemic, reports of burnout surged, with one global survey of more than 7,000 employees in late 2020 showing that upwards of 90% reported experiencing some form of burnout.
But despite its prevalence and pervasiveness, business leaders, managers and employees have widely failed to address both its causes and consequences in a meaningful way.
Worse still, burnout is widely stigmatised.
One study from 2007 showed stigma to be one of the greatest barriers to the treatment of mental-health challenges; another, from 2020, noted that perceived stigma may reflect the belief that most people view burnt out individuals as less competent than those who are not burnt out.Data from the CDC shows women are more likely than men to talk about mental health and seek treatment – exposing them to this competence myth.
But even when individuals speak out and are taken seriously, the mechanism and resources to support them often don’t exist.That lack of institutional support means workers may find themselves at the brink – especially those who are not in a position to walk away from their jobs, or simply approach their superiors for help.‘Someone like you'Some experts now believe, however, that Ardern’s resignation could be a sign that the conversation is shifting, and that leaders are recognising their employees’ mental health as a strategic priority.Experts believe there are several features that distinguish Ardern as a potential catalyst for unprecedented change.
First, data shows she is widely respected.
Even though her popularity had slipped in recent months, her leadership was – during much of her term – applauded.
The term “Jacindamania” that emerged during her tenure indicated her near-icon status on a global scale.Although some experts say Ardern's actions could help women who see themselves in her, others believe female leadership could be questioned (Credit: Getty Images)Arden is also widely considered relatable.
From her lockdown Facebook Live broadcasts – replete with toddler interruption – to her shows of emotion and impulsive gaffes, she made relatability a core tenet of her leadership style.
“It’s rare that a single person’s experience can speak universally to all people and create seismic shifts in perception,” says Iona Holloway, Boston-based author of Ghost: Why Perfect Women Shrink.
“Seeing your life experiences mirrored in 'someone like you' is incredibly valuable.”Holloway adds Ardern’s honesty around burnout can be particularly affecting to women, who have watched her navigate some extremely challenging years as a young mother on a public stage.Some of these experts also believe this transparency and honesty has played a critical role in demystifying burnout.
“Burnout is prevalent and widely covered, but it’s often talked about abstractly as a collection of signs and symptoms,” explains Holloway.
“Having someone like Ardern connected to the topic makes it more real and relatable for people.”Ultimately, all these factors may well help individuals to recognise and admit to struggling.
They may also serve as a reminder “that leaders talking openly about their own personal experiences can help reshape norms and change cultures”, says Lorraine Hariton, CEO of workplace-consultancy Catalyst.“I believe her transparency and authenticity in communicating her decision to resign moves the discourse towards normalising being human at work – at any level,” echoes Natasha Velikoselskiy, executive coach, organisational psychologist and adjunct assistant professor of business at Columbia Business School.
She adds that throughout her tenure, Ardern has modelled self-awareness and confidence – two traits business leaders and employees need to have a meaningful conversation around mental health and vulnerability in the workplace.Entrenched and toxicNot everyone is certain that Ardern’s resignation is truly going to affect positive change, however.One reason to be sceptical may lie in the reality that although many high-profile personalities around the globe – including Arianna Huffington, Simone Biles and Naomi Osaka ­– have spoken out about burnout, the needle hasn’t really shifted on de-stigmatisation, or increased resources for workers.
That isn’t necessarily because the individuals who speak out lack credibility or influence, but because of the nature of burnout and why it occurs: it goes hand-in-hand with some of the most toxic and entrenched features of many workplace cultures, like presenteeism and fierce competitiveness.
And some aren’t convinced that the characteristics that distinguish Ardern as a role model when it comes to this will be sufficient to truly affect change.“[Arden speaking out] opens the conversation, but it won’t change the root cause of the issue,” explains Adela Hussain, a London-based management consultant and entrepreneur.
“Most people overwork because they are influenced by their culture, social policy or poorly defined roles.”Some experts even question whether it might backfire for women’s credibility in leadership.
“The danger with Jacinda as a female leader sharing her vulnerability is that there’s room now for misogynists to question whether women are capable of high-profile leadership,” adds Hussain.Danna Greenberg, professor of organisational behaviour at US-based Babson College, agrees.
“I worry that authenticity on the part of high-profile women leaders will only fuel gender bias that women do not have the strength and resilience to lead – particularly in high-pressure situations,” she says, referencing recent data showing that trust in women leaders has fallen.“While I want to believe that Prime Minister Arden’s honesty might further normalise conversations around mental health, I worry that this will in fact do the opposite and simply fuel bias against working mothers and their ascent to leadership roles,” adds Greenberg.It’s also important to acknowledge Ardern’s privilege.
For all her relatability, her job rendered her one of the world’s most powerful women: a status that a tiny minority of people will ever come close to achieving.In other words, stepping down from a job as head of a country does not entail the same risks as quitting a salaried job in a corporation.
Burnout is often ignored and suppressed because of fears related to job security and concerns that showing vulnerability might lead to the perception of being unemployable.
And walking away from a job to prioritise mental health is simply economically unfeasible ­– even unimaginable – for most people.Still, even if this moment is not entirely transformative, there may be reasons to be optimistic that it could at least further the conversation around burnout.
“Whether or not the society at large is prepared to see and accept the reality of these issues in their full complexity, I believe that trailblazers like Ardern are helping dismantle the myths and bring the discourse to the next level of transparency and impact,” says Velikoselskiy.“Human leaders were never meant to be invincible, invulnerable and emotionless,” she continues, “and unravelling those myths at the highest levels of power will help accelerate the long-overdue turn towards embracing one’s own and others’ humanity as an integral part of leadership – not an impediment or a weakness.”

worklife,"Warning: This story includes details of traumatic birth that some readers may find distressingWhen Emma Carr fell pregnant in 2021, she had a vision for her ideal birth.
At the most basic level, she wanted to feel empowered, listened to and in control.
But, like many women, Carr’s vision went further than that.
In particular, she hoped for a 'natural birth' – generally described as a vaginal delivery with as little medical intervention and pharmacological pain relief as possible.She followed two courses, including one popular approach known as 'hypnobirthing', which taught relaxation and breathing to help ease pain and help stay present during delivery.
And, as her instructors recommended, she watched videos of healthy, happy, non-traumatic births to get her into the right mindset.
""You watch all these videos of these babies being born, and it's so beautiful,"" says Carr, 36, who lives in London.
“They come out really easily, and the woman grabs them, and you're just like, 'That's what'll happen to me'.
""But when Carr's water broke, the fluid contained meconium – the foetus' stool, which can be dangerous for mother and child.
After she rushed to hospital, doctors told her they had to get the baby out immediately.
Two hours later, she lay on the operating table under bright lights.
Far from her ideal, intervention-free vaginal birth, her baby was born by caesarean section.
Worst of all, she says, was how unprepared she felt for this kind of outcome, given how focused she had been – and had been encouraged to be in the courses she followed – on creating a positive mindset.
""If I hadn't had in my head how it 'should' have gone, then I wouldn't feel like it was a failure,"" she says.
""I just wish [my instructors] were a bit more open about how these births happen.
That it doesn't always go right, just because you did hypnobirthing.""
While she was pregnant, Carr says friends tried to warn her she might not have the labour she was hoping for.
But she dismissed them, thinking they probably hadn't gone in with the mindset or techniques she would.
""People that you would normally listen to, you stop listening to, because you've got these other people in your head telling you birth should be natural and magical, and that your body is just perfectly designed to do it,"" she says.
""But I don't think mine was.
""Many women do benefit from this approach to birth.
Some even experience the ideal scenario that they hoped for.
With the right techniques – like breathing, listening to affirmations or massage – some advocates say birth can be enjoyable, even orgasmic.
But others, like Carr, are left reeling, and not only from a traumatic birth – they feel as if having been fixated on that vision, and not preparing for the many ways in which it might not happen, made their experience even worse.Birth of a movementFor much of history, women frequently died in labour – as often as in one in every 100 births in the 1600s and 1700s.
Scientific advances including antibiotics mean that the maternal mortality rate has plummeted.
As the medical community expanded its focus beyond safety, narcotic pain reduction techniques like the epidural became common in many countries.
Even today, maternal mortality is highest in countries where there might not be adequate medical care for complications more easily treated elsewhere.After preparing themselves for an 'ideal' birth experiences, some women feel as if they've failed if they end up having medical intervention, like C-section (Credit: Getty Images)Many birthing parents choose modern pain-management as the right choice for them, and many doctors also recommend it.
But other women and health practitioners believe the birthing process has gone too far in this direction, saying that an over-reliance on medical interventions can be unnecessary, risky, even dehumanising.
In the 1960s, for example, women in wealthy countries often gave birth while sedated with general anaesthesia.
They may not have felt pain, but they couldn't feel present or make in-the-moment decisions regarding their care, either.
Today, many women now strive for – and idealise – what is often referred to as a 'positive birth'.
Coined by UK birth campaigner and Positive Birth Movement founder Milli Hill, the term 'positive birth' wasn't, originally, meant to describe any particular kind of labour.
It has broadened.
""A positive birth does not have to be 'natural' or 'drug free' – it simply has to be informed from a place of positivity as opposed to fear,"" the association's website reads.
""You can birth with positivity in hospital or at home, with or without medical intervention.""
Rather, the website outlines, it is an experience where a woman feels she has ""freedom of choice, access to accurate information, and that she is in control, powerful and respected"" as well as one that she ""goes on to enjoy, and later remember with warmth and pride"".
Still, many women who follow positive birth courses say they feel an undercurrent of idealising 'natural' births in particular.
For some instructors, a big part in emphasising how birth can be 'positive' comes with talking about how a woman's body is 'designed' to give birth – and the subtext can be that medical interventions impede, rather than assist, this process.A main tenet of many of these approaches, for example, is that fear and anxiety increase the body's production of hormones like adrenaline, which can slow down labour and make contractions feel worse.
With techniques including making one's birth space feel homey and comfortable; being supported by a birth partner (or team); using breathing or meditation techniques; and, above all, going into labour feeling relaxed and confident, the idea is that you can encourage the production of oxytocin instead, making labour faster and less painful.
The popularisation of 'natural' birth in particular has a long history: it dates back to at least the 1930s, interestingly around the same time that the first college of obstetrics and gynaecology was founded.
And for many women, approaches like these have never held much weight: if you want to give birth as painlessly as possible, why not just use every modern medical intervention and drug available?But for others, this image of the 'natural' ideal birth has stuck, amplified by a booming birth-education industry.
On social media, beautiful stories of relaxed water births with soothing music and candles everywhere abound.There are many benefits to these birth movements, not least their aims to put the decision-making back into the birthing parent's hands.
But with both 'positive' and 'natural' increasing as common cultural ideals, for some women, there is a downside.
No number of classes or relaxation techniques can always overcome the reality that the circumstances of every birth are different; that there are huge racial and ethnic disparities in quality of care; that maternity care can be subpar overall; or that women sometimes feel pressured to accept interventions.
Even the simplest goals of feeling empowered during labour, or having fond memories of birth, can feel out of reach.
(It's also worth noting that both the time and financial investment that some of these courses require make them out of reach for many – they can cost less than $50 (£41) online or upwards of $1,000 [£815] for private guidance, and usually require at least several hours of instruction).Proponents of this approach say that medical providers need to step up to fix these problems, rather than mothers lowering their expectations.
But in the meantime, for women whose labours don’t go as planned, having a highly specific – and often idealised – birth vision in mind can put undue pressure on what is, ultimately, an unpredictable experience.
In the worst case, they can feel as if they have failed themselves – or their babies.
An ideal – not a norm The 'natural' birth, in which everything unfolds perfectly and without a need for intervention, remains far from the norm.
In the US in 2020, for example, CDC data shows nearly a third of all births included an induction of labour.
In addition, a third were caesarean deliveries (C-sections).
Home births, often held up as the ultimate 'natural' labour, accounted for just 1% of all births.But for many birthing parents who emphasise natural birth as the goal of their 'positive' approach, their labours don't always go to plan – and this can have ripple effects.
Some mothers say that, by focusing only on their ideal birth, they were blindsided by the reality – and felt additional grief for not getting to experience the perfect birth they wanted.
In one study, 15% of women who had an unplanned C-section reported that they felt as though they’d ""failed"".Edwina Moorhouse considers herself a 'positive' birth convert after smooth birth experiences with all three of her children (Credit: Courtesy of Edwina Moorhouse)This article is part of the BBC’s Family Tree series.
Explore more from Amanda Ruggeri, including in-depth looks at motherhood ambivalence and why new mums are expected to ‘bounce back’ quickly.In Toronto, Andie Perris, 38, wanted ""as much of a natural experience as possible"" before her first birth.
She took a hypnobirthing course, listened to relaxation audio tracks and read Ina May Gaskin's On Childbirth, which was ""full of stories of serene deliveries of women breathing down their babies and their body taking over"", she says.
""I had seen and heard of these beautiful birth stories, and that's what I was expecting for myself because I had done all the work,"" she says.
""I really believed that it would change the outcome of my delivery.""
Instead, Perris was in labour for almost 24 hours.
Her pelvic floor was ""completely destroyed"".
Her son, who wasn't descending properly, was ultimately delivered by vacuum.
Perris had a postpartum haemorrhage.Looking back, she says, she probably should have had a C-section.
But she had been set against it.
""Feeling like there was one 'right' way to have a baby, it made me laser focused on that right way,"" she says.
""And of course, there's not one right way.
But I was so wrapped up in this vision of how nature 'intended' you to have a baby.
""Because she was so focused on maintaining a positive mindset going into her labour, Perris says, she didn’t prepare herself for the possibility that it might go differently.
As a result, ""when things started to go sideways, it was very hard for me to adapt"".For her second child, she tried to listen to the same relaxation audio tracks she'd used to prepare for her first.
She found it so anxiety inducing that she had to stop.Emiliana Hall is a UK-based doula and founder of The Mindful Birth Group, which helps women prepare for birth.
Hall, who says her approach eschews idealising any form of labour and instead covers all potential outcomes, reports she is now seeing a wave of second-time mothers saying that, after doing a 'positive' birth approach, their first experience didn't go as they thought.The problem, says Hall, isn't just that they had a negative experience.
It's that they blame themselves for it.
This can be the risk of an approach that focuses so much on mindset, she says: many courses recommend listening only to positive birth stories, or even replacing negative words like ""contractions"" with ""surges"", to keep fear and anxiety, and therefore stress hormones and, theoretically, pain, at bay.
If a woman does wind up feeling pain or trauma, she might question if it was because she wasn't relaxed enough.
""When it doesn't work, it feels like either they failed, or it was a complete waste of time,"" says Hall.
""But there are so many things that you can't control.""
In her courses, says Hall, she is careful not to even use the phrase ""positive birth"" – because despite teaching techniques to make birth better, she's acutely aware that there's no guarantee things will go as planned.
'I can't just have been lucky three times, right?'
Of course, plenty of mothers have found positive birth approaches helpful, even transformative.In Berlin, Edwina Moorhouse, 32, thought they sounded ""hippie"".
But after watching a YouTube vlogger enthuse about her experience, she put aside her scepticism.
""I really wanted that joy that you see that she has,"" she says.
She took a hypnobirthing course, practised breathing techniques and underwent weekly acupuncture.
She had a smooth, fast water birth.
Her second labour was similar.
By her third child, where she dragged pink Himalayan salt lamps, big headphones and warm socks to her hospital room to make it cosier, she was a convert.
""I can't just have been lucky three times, right?
There must be something to this,"" she says.
""To think that by my third son, I was religiously listening to hypnobirthing mp3s, flooding my brain with positive stories on YouTube, spending a stupid amount of money on this one shampoo that had a scent that offered instant pain relief – I am completely unrecognisable to the woman that was pregnant six years ago.""
Indeed, there is some evidence that the techniques taught in many of these birth courses can reduce pain and epidural use, lessen the number of interventions and the length of labour itself, lower C-section rates, and improve a mother's overall birth experience.
But these findings aren't always replicated, and some aspects seem to be more useful than others.
One large review showed although some popular elements, like the presence of a trained birth partner or using music or massage to relax, helped reduce the likelihood that a woman would look back on her birth experience as ""negative"", other techniques were less useful.Another review showed music, yoga and relaxation techniques like guided meditations might help reduce pain.
But they made no difference in lowering the rates of birth interventions including C-sections, or of whether women ultimately needed pharmacological pain relief.From a medical standpoint, it's generally accepted that, since each intervention has its own risks and costs, they shouldn't be done unnecessarily or, in the case of pain-management interventions, without full, informed consent.
An epidural, for example, may be linked to a longer second stage of labour and higher chance of needing an instrumental birth and, in rare cases, fever or nerve damage.
But women who follow 'positive' birth approaches say that the undertone sometimes can go further than that, making birthing parents feel as if any intervention is ""bad"".
""The message is that you're made for it, it's natural, women have been doing it since the dawn of time, your body knows what it's doing, your baby knows what it's doing,"" says Beth Sandland, a lifestyle blogger and founder of the digital magazine The Motherhood Edit.
""I wouldn't say it's fear mongering.
But I would say that there is definitely an undertone of, 'the hospitals don't necessarily act in your best interest.
The doctors don't necessarily have a realistic approach to physiological birth'"" in some of the courses and social-media accounts that she's seen, says the 26-year-old.For many, the most important aspect of having a 'positive' birth comes down to one thing: autonomy (Credit: Getty Images)Yet interventions alone aren't necessarily the ultimate arbiter of a 'positive' experience.
Indeed, research has found that one of the most important aspects of whether a woman thought her birth was positive was how long the labour took.
Those who had shorter labours were more satisfied – even when their labour was shortened by an intervention like, say, oxytocin augmentation.
Given the effect of prolonged labour, the researchers concluded, ""interventions to avoid that could result in a 'net benefit'"".
For many women, of course, interventions also can be lifesaving.
""How it's presented is like, you don't have to do what they tell you.
And like the doctors are kind of out to get you, in a way,"" says Carr.
""They're like, 'Oh, it's not risky.
It's natural.'
That can be true, but not always.
I think for me, there was risk.
If I hadn't had any medical intervention, one of us might not have survived … I don't think in the wild I would have birthed that baby easily.
""'I studied for it like it was an exam' A big part of the positive birth movement involves empowerment.
Indeed, feeling in control and being involved in decision-making is a big part of having had a positive experience.
And even if there are complications during delivery, some women still find certain techniques that help them feel in control to be useful.
In Glasgow, Anna Murray, 34, did all of the preparation she possibly could for her labour.
""I studied for it like it was an exam,"" she says.
She did a private course with a doula, read books, followed a yoga hypnobirthing course.
She even had a Google Drive folder with all of her audio tracks and yoga videos for different birth positions.In the end, she needed an unexpected caesarean – her son had grown too big and was in a fixed position that no amount of exercises could turn.
But the breathing techniques helped her stay calm on the operating table, she says.
""It can help you have a calm controlled birth whatever you have.
But ultimately, it can't really give you any more control over what's going to happen,"" she says.Murray's birth speaks to the nuanced nature of how many women experience the positive birth ideal today.
For some, it pans out exactly as they dreamed, and gives them the techniques to help make it happen.
For others, it's a crushing disappointment.
And for those like Murray, the techniques can provide useful tools to make the best out of a difficult situation.Ultimately, for many, the most important aspect of having a positive birth comes down to one thing: autonomy.
That doesn't just mean feeling empowered, whether in a labour ward or at a home birth.
It also means not feeling pressured to birth in any specific way.And, as a culture, it means recognising that every woman’s physiology, medical conditions and birth process will look different, being careful not to lionise any particular kind of experience as a cookie-cutter ideal – whether it’s one that takes place under anaesthesia or in a candlelit bath.

worklife,"Matthew has been in a middle-management role at an online education centre for seven years.
Having awkward conversations is an everyday part of his job.“I often have to end up begging or sweet-talking teachers to cancel their plans or time off, so we have cover: ‘I know tomorrow is your day off, but we’re really short-staffed’,” he explains.
“I can be put in a really difficult spot, especially towards the end of the month when we’re approaching sales targets.”Originally hired as an English teacher, Matthew, who is withholding his surname for job-security concerns, was thrust into a supervisory role when his Taiwan-based company asked him to create a Japanese-language department.
“I majored in Japanese, so that was that,” he says.
“I began training and recruiting employees, and reporting back to supervisors and the boss.
I wasn’t given any training: I had to learn the ropes on the job.” Matthew is one of the many mid-ranking bosses who are somewhere between the top and bottom of an organisation.
They’re often pushed by leadership to execute business goals, while pulled by employees who may have different expectations and needs.
“I don’t know if I’m unpopular, but I occasionally have to put my foot down – and leave some people annoyed or disappointed that they have to fill in for a ton of shifts.”In many cases, high-performing employees simply end up in supervisory roles as the default next step on the career ladder.
Sometimes, they receive little training or organisational support for this promotion.
These in-between managers face pressure from both executives and lower-level colleagues, and can find themselves feeling powerless and ill-equipped to satisfy everyone’s demands.
Because of this, middle managers are frequently cast as the villain: the bureaucratic, ineffective ‘yes-man’ that embodies corporate dogma.Realistically, however, most of these bosses aren’t actually trying to make workers’ lives miserable.
Instead, they’re caught in a difficult place, having to manage their team’s requests, personalities and workloads, while also attempting to hit their own goals and satisfy their bosses.
Deconstructing the mythMiddle managers are at the crux of an organisation, sitting at a natural point of tension between executives and employees.“It’s they who are responsible for making the strategic imperatives of the organisation happen,” says Jim Link, the chief human resources officer at the Society for Human Resource Management (Shrm), based in Virginia, US.
“They’re expected to execute tasks set by the organisation, which are often committed to shareholders.”Alongside pressure from their own bosses, these supervisors are usually the first to field employee requests like holidays, flexible working and pay rises – and therefore the first to reject them if needed.
Matthew agrees that the hardest aspect of being a middle manager is managing people – both up and down his organisation.
“You end up being the person standing in the way of an employee’s next vacation, or their sister’s wedding,” he says.
“Not only do you need to know how to manage your colleagues, but you also need to learn how to manage the people above you.”This friction can create conflict between mid-ranking bosses and the workers they manage.
“Their job is responding to demands from competing stakeholders, not necessarily aligned with one another,” says Christopher Kayes, professor of management at the George Washington University School of Business, based in Washington, DC.
“It means being a middle manager can be very unmanageable.”Tasked with ensuring workers do their jobs effectively, middle managers can often be seen as an envoy for a company’s big bosses, rather than the employees they lead, adds Kayes.
“One employee told me they’d never go into management because it would mean they’d have to act unethically.
The narrative can be that managers are part of the ‘system’: what could be an individual trying their best to fit leadership goals within the day-to-day of the organisation might be considered a set of unethical behaviours by an employee.”“In effect, they serve multiple masters: their superiors who set the goals, and those working for them in helping to accomplish the tasks,” adds Link.
“The construct itself is a little damning for middle managers.”Experts say the reality about middle managers is that they're under just as much stress as their reports – if not more (Credit: Getty Images)Stark contrastsFor these reasons, middle management is a hard job: mid-ranking bosses are expected to juggle vast organisational issues while catering to people with conflicting agendas – and trying to get their own tasks done in the meantime.
It’s a role made tougher by the fact that they’re often left without the support or resources to thrive.Employees, highly adept in a technical role, can be promoted to management without necessarily having the required skills.
“In tech, someone could be an excellent coder and be rewarded with a promotion to middle management,” says Kayes.
“However, their coding abilities won’t help them.
Instead, they need to know how to coordinate a team, motivate and influence others – a completely different skillset versus being a technical expert.”Many employees promoted to supervisory positions don’t receive any training in soft skills like emotional intelligence and empathy, and might unintentionally stoke tensions among junior workers whenever an issue arises.
“It’s expensive and takes years to develop an employee into an effective manager,” says Kayes, “and most companies are focused on immediate results.”The focus of a middle manager’s direct reports, however, is almost entirely on people skills.
In an August 2020 survey of 457 US workers by SHRM, 84% said poorly trained people managers created much unnecessary work and stress.
Workers cited effective communication (41%), developing and training teams (38%) and managing team performance (35%) as areas that managers could improve upon.Of course, not every manager is perpetually unprepared, and some companies do provide management training.
And many managers who are expected to learn on the job do just that – something Matthew says he’s been able to do.
“I’ve only received some organisational support – it’s ultimately a fast-moving environment, so it’s hard for the company to keep teaching you,” he says.
“Nearly all of it has been just doing it myself, trying things out and learning from mistakes.”However, even for supervisors who have been able to improve their skills with experience, the new shape of the workplace moulded by the Covid-19 pandemic has posed novel challenges, which can often create friction.
Many middle managers are underprepared for the demands of remote- and hybrid working.
In a changed world of work, supervisors are often relying on old practices, say experts.
“A leader now needs to apply their skillset in a completely new way, without their teams being physically present,” says Link.
“The expectations of managers are different following the Great Resignation, alongside evolving labour-market trends and a mental-health crisis among the workforce.”  This means that middle managers – who are already in a difficult place by nature of their jobs – may be struggling to keep things together even more than before.Additionally, Kayes says managers have also been unfairly omitted from conversations around burnout following the pandemic.
“Managers are often treated separately from the workforce, yet they experience the same issues – and perhaps even worse than those who aren’t in supervisory roles.
Their job is a recipe for stress and anxiety.” And unless managerial positions are filled by employees with strong people skills, or organisations invest more in leadership training, the narrative that frames middle managers as villains will likely continue.Kayes says issues like the ongoing hiring crisis, the difficulties in leading hybrid teams and dealing with flexible working requests have created unsolvable problems for managers to fix; bereft of organisational support, they instead face the wrath of junior employees.
“We’ve never been in a scenario where it’s so difficult to hire and retain workers, while increasing employee demands only adds to the challenge.
Most organisations aren’t equipped in their policies and procedures to deal with these requests – let alone middle managers.”  It might be time to cut the office’s resident bogeyman some slack: middle managers, after all, are often much less powerful than they might appear.
Some empathy and collegial goodwill could help make everyone’s work lives a bit easier.
“It’s they who are asked to be responsible for how things are run,” says Kayes, “yet they don’t necessarily have authority or the resources to control, fix and change longer-term problems.”

You may have done everything within your power to attain the perfect job, and yet the daily grind sometimes saps you of your enthusiasm.
“In my experience with my coaching clients, I would say that is a big issue, and that this problem is growing,” says Anna K Schaffner, a life coach in the UK, who specialises in exhaustion, burnout and resilience, and the author of The Art of Self-Improvement.For some, a loss of passion may be a sign that you need to change careers – but such a drastic move is not always possible.
Fortunately, recent studies show that some people naturally apply “cultivation strategies” to reignite their passion and motivation – and there are many ways we can all apply these techniques.
A matter of mindsetThe first study comes from Patricia Chen, a professor of psychology at the University of Texas at Austin, US.Chen’s previous research examined the influence of two different mindsets about passion.
So-called “fit theorists” are more likely to endorse statements such as:The “develop theorists”, in contrast, are more likely to agree with statements such as:Using detailed questionnaires that measure people’s mindsets and various workplace outcomes, Chen found that these beliefs become self-fulfilling prophecies.
The fit theorists will struggle to find happiness in a job that doesn’t meet their specific criteria.
The develop theorists, in contrast, can learn to find enjoyment and interest in the different tasks, so that their satisfaction grows over time, even if the job didn’t initially tick all the desired boxes.Splitting up projects into quick, bite-size tasks can allow you to enjoy the warm feeling of satisfaction when you tick them off your plan (Credit: Getty Images)Chen’s new paper aims to explore how the develop theorists manage their passion in this way.
What strategies do they use to fan the flames of their zeal for work?To find out, she first surveyed 316 undergraduates of various academic disciplines about the ways their passion for their subject had changed throughout time.
Crucially, this included an open-ended question on what had caused this change in passion.
From the hundreds of responses, the researchers identified five common strategies that the students claimed had raised their motivation.
They were:Overall, Chen confirmed that the students with the develop mindset were more likely to see positive increases in their passion for their subject over time, and that change was correlated with the number of the passion cultivation strategies that they had used.
The students with the fit mindset, in contrast, did not seem to be employing those strategies so effectively.Making motivationChen’s findings chime with broader psychological research looking at the ways that people regulate their interest and motivation in their work.
Besides confirming the use of the strategies that Chen had identified – such as identifying the personal or societal relevance of the work – these studies suggest a few other ways of reviving your mojo.
Two of the most useful techniques are “proximal goal setting” and “self-consequating”.
These are particularly useful when you feel overwhelmed with a new project, in which the challenge is so great, and the reward so distant, that you struggle to summon up the enthusiasm to get started.To apply proximal goal setting, you would split the project into bite-size tasks that are much quicker to complete – allowing you to enjoy the warm feeling of satisfaction when you tick them off your plan.
“This can be especially effective if you use little rewards for achieving those goals such as watching Netflix, after you’ve completed an assignment,” says Maike Trautner, a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Münster, Germany.
That’s the self-consequating part.Once again, mindset matters.
In a recent study with Malte Schwinger, a professor at Philipps University of Marburg in Germany, Trautner surveyed more than 700 students on the ways they handle their motivation.
Just as Chen observed with her work on passion, they found that some students believe that motivation for a task is fixed and unchangeable, while others believe that it can be cultivated.
And it is those with the latter mindset who will then look for ways to build their motivation using practical strategies, while those who believed their motivation was beyond their control were less proactive.
Taking actionFor people who already have the develop mindset, these strategies may seem obvious.
But Chen’s work suggests they are in the minority: in her samples, most people had the fit mindset, and could therefore benefit from being reminded of their potential to build their motivation and passion.Taking some time to think about our overall goals, looking for the benefits our work is providing to others, reaching out to inspirational colleagues and setting out a plan with small rewards – these are simple strategies that we could all take to boost our enthusiasm.Taking up a hobby can give you a sense of purpose and achievement, so that your job is not the only place to find satisfaction in your life (Credit: Getty Images)You don’t have to assume all the responsibility, however.
Schaffner suggests talking to your boss about the ways you can change your job so that it is more closely aligned with your values and interests – a process she describes as “job crafting”.
“Good employers should be interested in that and supportive of the idea: it makes perfect sense for their employees to be given tasks that they are most suited to perform well,” she says.If you still feel like you are in a rut, you might simply be asking too much from your career.
In much the same way that we might expect our romantic partners to generate all the excitement in our life – which puts unnecessary pressure on the relationship – we can sometimes have unrealistic expectations of our jobs to provide meaning in our lives.For this reason, Schaffner suggests taking up a hobby that could also give you a sense of purpose and achievement, so that your job is not the only place to find satisfaction in your life.
“Ironically, with a little bit of detachment and perspective, we tend to work better, and with more levity,” she says.It’s a philosophy I’ve tried to apply myself.
On these bleak January days, I’ve tried to bolster my energy by reminding myself of all the reasons I was first drawn to a career in journalism and by taking more time to read people’s responses to my writing – an activity that is often overlooked in the face of pressing deadlines.
But on Schaffner’s advice, I’m also making sure that I spend more time on all the other activities I love.In her words: “It can be incredibly healing and curative when work is just work.”David Robson is a science writer and author of The Expectation Effect: How Your Mindset Can Transform Your Life, published by Canongate (UK) and Henry Holt (USA).

worklife,"As 2022 comes to a close, we're bringing back our favourite pieces of the year.
See the rest of our Best of Worklife 2022 collection for more great reads.“The first [several] years of our marriage we had an amazing sex life … and as he got older (he’s 30 now), he just doesn't seem interested in sex anymore.”This is one of many comments floating around the r/DeadBedrooms subreddit on the social-media platform Reddit – a self-described “discussion group for Redditors who are coping with a relationship that is seriously lacking in sexual intimacy”.
Frustrated anecdotes like these abound from people who are in low- or zero-sex relationships.
“Why does he prefer his own hand over having sex with me?” one poster asks.
The subreddit’s outlook is relatively bleak: “Advice is always appreciated,” reads its description, “just don't be surprised if we've heard it all.”While it may seem natural enough for these stories to come from older couples struggling to retain the spark they had decades earlier, many are posted by people who self-identify as being in their late 20s or 30s.
Some say children or marriages put a halt to their sex lives; others say their “low-libido” husbands can watch endless pornography, yet won’t get aroused with them.
The list of grievances continues from throngs of millennials posting about their ‘dead bedrooms’.Although millennials are in or around their sexual prime, some members of this generation around the world have reportedly been “retreating from sex”.
Accounts from millennials forums including r/DeadBedrooms corroborate this, especially for married and long-term couples.
Some recent statistics tell a similar story: a 2021 survey of adults ages 18 to 45 across the US, conducted by the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University and sex-retailer Lovehoney, showed that among married adults, millennials were the most likely to “report problems with sexual desire in the past year”.
The survey showed 25.8% of married millennials reported this problem, while only 10.5% of married Gen Z and 21.2% of married Gen X adults reported the same.Although “low desire isn’t necessarily synonymous with being in a sexless marriage”, says Justin Lehmiller, research fellow at the Kinsey Institute, “when one or both partners in a marriage experience a drop-off in desire for sex, sexual frequency usually declines – and loss of desire is one of the biggest reasons why marriages become sexless in the first place”.What, exactly, is going on?
Sex therapists and researchers suggest a variety of factors that may explain millennials’ sexless marriages, from their current life stages to the almighty influence of the internet.
Regardless of the specific reasons causing sexual fractures in the bedroom, overwhelmingly, this generation is facing some unique – even unprecedented – obstacles to healthy sex lives.Many millennials are having children, which can be a prime disruption in sexual desire (Credit: Getty Images)The anatomy of a sexless marriageThere are multiple definitions of a sexless marriage.
One is literal: the couple has not had any sex at all for a long period of time.
Another widely used measure for a sexless marriage is having sex fewer than 10 times a year.Experts who spoke with BBC Worklife also had varying ideas.
New York City-based sex therapist Stephen Snyder says, “I usually think of ‘sexless’ as four times a year or less,” unless that couple is “having sex quarterly and they both say it's awesome”.
Kimberly Anderson, sex therapist and assistant professor of psychiatry at UCLA's School of Medicine, puts the rate of a ‘low-sex’ marriage at fewer than 25 times per year.
Others say the definition is purely subjective; if a couple is unhappy with the frequency at which they’re having sex, there’s a problem worth addressing.
Many factors can lead to a sexless or low-sex marriage.
If there’s a “desire discrepancy”, as California-based sex therapist Christene Lozano puts it, that imbalance can grow over time if the couple doesn’t do a good job of addressing it.
The person who wants more sex and keeps initiating it might give up and lose self-esteem if they continue to get rejected, for instance.
Meanwhile, the partner doing the rejecting might feel increasingly guilty, altogether creating even worse conditions for fostering arousal.Other factors including medical or mental-health issues can also contribute, as these can make sex impossible, painful, difficult or undesirable.
Busy lives, with work and/or children, can remove sex from the equation, too, as can poor communication about each partner’s desires.Although these aspects contributing to sexless marriages aren’t particular to any generation, some experts have noticed a shift in who’s experiencing sexless relationships, and at what periods in their lives.“It’s become a shorter amount of time in which [couples] become sexless,” believes San Francisco-based sex therapist Celeste Hirschman, who’s been seeing clients for about 20 years.
Anecdotally, she used to see it take around 10 to 15 years for couples to stop having sex with each other.
“Now, it’s maybe taking three to five,” she says.Anderson, who’s been working as a sex therapist for 30 years, says the demographics of sexless marriages have indeed changed since she started practicing.
“Thirty years ago, a majority of the couples I treated for sexless marriage were 50-plus,” she says, struggling with decreased libido from the hormonal changes and illnesses that come with aging.Today, however, most of the couples in sexless marriages that Anderson sees are 45 and younger.
“The underlying dynamics are quite different than they were/are with older couples,” she says.The weight of stressToo much stress can get in the way of anyone’s sex life – and millennials are especially riddled with cortisol.
“Stress is one of the biggest libido killers,” says Lehmiller, “and millennials are a particularly stressed group in many ways, especially compared to Gen X.”Major life stages are one factor.
Many millennials are at the age at which they’re becoming new parents or have young children, an overwhelming time in people’s lives.
In a 2018 study from UK-based counselling network Relate, 61% of people in their 30s reported having less sex than they’d like because “young children are in the way”, with 31% saying they’ve “lost their libido since having children”.
Other generational struggles also feed into stress; millennials were already behind prior generations to meet life milestones, like buying homes; now, spiking prices  and the proliferation of student debt are straining millennials, especially financially.But most of all, the current state of the workplace is driving stress.
May 2022 data from global consulting firm Deloitte, collected across five countries, revealed 38% of millennials reported a massive mental-health burden, especially for women (41%) versus men (36%), largely driven by work anxiety.The working environment has never been particularly stable or low stress for millennials, of course.
“For example, many millennials started their careers during the Great Recession,” says Lehmiller.
But the added burden of the Covid-19 pandemic has brought with it further strife.“During times of great technological change, people tend to work extremely hard,” adds Snyder.
And as data shows, millennials are particularly workaholics.
Overwork often leads to exhaustion, which can lead to couples repeatedly being too tired for sex at the end of a long day – a pattern these experts say can endure if repeated too regularly.
And worries around financial stability are only exacerbating the problem.
“Greater financial concerns coupled with higher baseline rates of depression and anxiety could be a particularly potent combination in producing high stress and low sexual desire,” says Lehmiller.Some experts report that the rise of easily accessible pornography and image-driven social media are interrupting intimacy (Credit: Getty Images)Social media, pornography and declining sex livesThe influence of the internet also can’t be overstated.
Snyder describes social media as a “distraction” from physical interpersonal activities like sex, but Hirschman believes its role in contributing to sexless marriages goes much deeper.
She says it’s led to increased “image consciousness” among millennials – the first generation to really be conscripted into heavy social-media use.
People feel the need to present perfection on these platforms, she says, with filters and touch-ups that aren’t available in real life.
The resulting self-consciousness can follow people into their bedrooms and marriages, making them less body confident.
Per Relate’s 2018 data, 37% of people younger than 30 who were in low-sex partnerships reported self-consciousness about their bodies, while only 14% of those 60 and older said the same.In addition to social media, the experts agree porn has had an outsized influence on millennials, many of whom came of age just as porn was becoming widely accessible online.
This, of course, is a huge shift from previous generations.
“In the 20th Century, some guys tended to be sexually compulsive with lots of women,” says Snyder.
“These days, they just tend to watch lots of porn.” In other words, they don’t have to seek out sex with another person to have a sexual experience that involves other people, even if those people are only in a video.Anderson has many younger-than-45 male clients in sexless marriages who suffer from “porn-induced erectile dysfunction”, she says – a condition that makes it either impossible or very difficult to achieve an erection without pornography and with a real-life partner.
This can lead to them preferring solo sex over sex with their partners.
Some of them get used to having total control over their pleasure, she explains, or to the more extreme images they see in porn that their married sex can’t live up to.
""‘Porn never rejects me’ or ‘Porn never criticises my performance’ are common comments in my office,” says Anderson.‘Dead bedrooms’ forever?
Of course, millennials can’t change that they entered the workforce during a recession and are now reeling from another one.
They can’t erase the influence of porn or social media.And it's clear that a lack of sex is a topic some people find hard to even talk about with the person with whom they are sharing a bedroom, let alone more broadly – making understanding the issues and finding solutions even harder.
As one Redditor wrote on r/DeadBedrooms just a couple days ago, with busy lives and myriad pressures, even raising the subject can seem impossible.
""I just don’t even know what to ask for anymore,"" wrote one struggling woman.
""I want to fix this, I just don’t know how.""

worklife,"When Christian got laid off in late 2022, he wasn’t surprised.
The 31-year-old, based in New York City, knew he’d fallen behind on his projects as a management consultant, and underperformed with essential job duties.“I had a tough time grappling with the sorts of executive functioning that our world operates by, like being able to set up meetings, follow through with things, focus and be detail oriented,” he says.
His manager had pointed out these failings for months, which is why his termination was hardly shocking.It’s not that he consciously slacked at work, says Christian – his ADHD got in the way.
Christian has been living with the diagnosis of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder since he was 15.
It helped put a name to why he struggles with certain tasks his peers often don’t – the same things that ultimately got him sacked.
And while his ADHD was mostly manageable through university, its effects ramped up when he got into the workforce.
It’s held him back ever since.Global data from 2020 estimates the rate of adult ADHD at 2.58% (yet many people remain undiagnosed, especially in minority communities).
This means millions experience hurdles like Christian’s – and some don’t even know why.
But even for people who do have a label for their struggles, a diagnosis isn’t necessarily a fix; many workers with ADHD experience challenges that can inhibit success.
And whether they reveal their issues to managers or keep them private, the effects of ADHD follow them around in their careers, affecting their job security, career options, work relationships and even how they feel about themselves.Yet as ADHD diagnoses tick up, so too has awareness – and this can help contextualise these workers’ struggles for both colleagues and employers, and potentially illuminate new pathways for support.Some workers with ADHD find it hard to get started, and differences like these can send them into a self-judgement spiral (Credit: Getty Images)More than ‘kids who fidget’ADHD is not just about oft-stereotyped ‘squirmy’ kids and people who get distracted easily, says Texas-based Tracy Winter, an executive and leadership coach at Nerd Coach, who specialises in neurodiversity.
Instead, ADHD is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder, which manifests in diverse symptoms and behaviours (though the word ‘disorder’ is controversial, points out Winter, who also has ADHD; she prefers to look at it as a “different kind of brain”).
The ADHD brain isn’t necessarily flighty, she explains – anatomically, it structurally looks different and functions differently.
People with ADHD each experience its effects diversely, says Henry Shelford, chairperson and co-founder of charity ADHD UK, and there’s no way to know how it’ll appear in someone’s life.
Some struggle with being on time, or keep a desk that looks like something exploded, for instance; others are neat as a pin and always punctual, yet can’t stop themselves from interrupting in conversation.
Some people, says Winter, only tend to do what they’re interested in – “what lights up our brains” – which causes them to de-prioritise other urgent tasks.Its effects in the workplace can be particularly acute, where norms around behaviour and processes can drive bosses to label ADHD employees lazy, disengaged or incapable.
“ADHD traits can be really badly misinterpreted,” says Shelford.
“If I struggle with timeliness, you’re going to think I don’t care about my job.
If I forget something, you might just conclude I’m dumb.” Beyond bosses’ perceptions, often, these workplace struggles can make workers with ADHD judge themselves, too, causing damaging emotional impacts.Rebecca Phillips Epstein, a television writer and essayist who was recently diagnosed with ADHD, struggled constantly in her early career to show up to meetings prepared and on time as well as hit deadlines.
The issues only compounded as she climbed the career ladder.
And while she could usually manage on the fly, she says she felt terrible constantly existing on the edge of failure.
“As I got older, the world got bigger… I started to slip, and I started to struggle,” explains Epstein, now 37.
Epstein felt she “should be able to do what everyone else can do”, so she wound up “torturing” herself, balancing perfectionism with a feeling of being incapable of performing as expected.
Christian, too, has been down on himself, despite knowing he’s neurodivergent (someone whose brain differences affect how their brain works).
“There’s a whole element of shame and guilt,” he says.
“[Your behaviours] start to close doors of opportunity, and then those doors are shut … When I just forget or stall something until last minute, I start to go down the spiral.
‘Why couldn't I do this?
Why aren't I good enough?
Why can't I do what this person could do?’”This self-judgement is one of the problematic knock-on effects that can send people with ADHD into negative emotional states.
“There can be an element of, like, ‘why bother, when I'm not going to do it right?
I'm just going to get [a] negative response’, says Winter.
This can trigger a common reaction of “rejection sensitivity dysphoria” , which she says “is a much deeper feeling of rejection at a critique” – one that can erode self-confidence and emotional wellbeing.
And although rejection sensitivity is not unique to people with ADHD, it can be exacerbated in people with the condition.The problem with ‘masking’Often, people with ADHD are uneasy about asking for help, because it means announcing their diagnosis.The stigma of ADHD is still very present – it can be viewed as a condition for children, or something that isn’t much of a challenge.
“There are plenty of people still out there who don't believe in ADHD,” says Winter.
This can lead to scepticism of the idea that some people’s brains function differently as a result.Many workers instead engage in “masking” to compensate.
“It’s an idea of ‘who do I need to present as to be accepted?’ … restraining oneself from a lot of natural impulses” just to fit in with colleagues, she says.
Masking can be effective for a short period of time, but it is rarely sustainable and often depleting.
“It’s almost like minimising your own identity to conform with social norms … It’s uncomfortable, and it’s exhausting, and if you do it enough, you can lose track of who is behind the mask.”Some workers with ADHD choose to keep their diagnoses and struggles secret for fear of judgement, which means they can't get the accommodations they need (Credit: Getty Images)For workers who do come forward about their diagnoses, however, the conversation can be risky.
In some situations, asking for accommodations – like fewer meetings or different working hours – may spur bosses and colleagues to view them as difficult to work with, or not cut out for the workflow of a team.That’s what Kim To found when she worked in finance in London in her early 20s – a position she thought of as a dream job.
But, she says, “I was crying every single day.” She was so tired from masking, she became overwhelmed.To help her succeed, she asked her boss for bits of help – an assistive app for grammar and spelling, and the ability to work from home away from distractions.
But her requests were met with corporate consternation.
When she tried to work around her challenges by creating her own systems, spreadsheets and schedules that other colleagues didn’t use, she says people would tell her that she was “just making excuses” for why she couldn’t perform like everyone else, or needed special treatment.Eventually, To stopped asking for accommodations, and tried to function like her colleagues.
But this didn’t work, either.
“People would observe me and think ‘oh, she’s not really cut out for this industry’, she says.
“It wasn’t so much the workflow.
I was actually very good at the work and I liked the work.
It was because I was constantly trying to conform.” She ultimately had a breakdown, and left the world of finance.
During the next five years, she began and quit several more jobs, always finding herself out of place.
Although she didn’t have an ADHD diagnosis at the time, she now realises her executive-function disorder was at the core of her struggles.Even for high performers, some bosses may question the need to provide accommodations, says Winter: “If [managers] don't see where the challenges are, why would they do anything to address them?” But, in many cases, she says a worker’s strong performance may come from masking to ultimately detrimental effects.
Forward stepsWorkers with ADHD will almost always have challenges in the workplace, even if they are able to work with understanding and accommodating bosses, or get the assistive tools they request.
But things may be looking up, at least in part.
As ADHD diagnoses have increased in the past decade, Sheldon says this knowledge has enabled more people to seek help from their employers.
Some managers may also be more open due to rising awareness – in some cases, as some see diagnoses within their own families, says Winter.Plus, the pursuit of a more accommodating workplace has had an unlikely hero: Covid-19.
Prior to the pandemic, working flexibly was rare, and it was difficult for all employees to make the personal adjustments that could help them succeed.
Now, far more people have autonomy over how and where they do their jobs.
So, as work cultures begin to become more adaptable than they once were, managers are increasingly aware workers can thrive in untraditional work cultures – something that can be particularly helpful for people with ADHD.
Of course, educating employers and making workplaces more inclusive is important, too.
Now 28, To has become a coach and speaker who works with both employees and corporations to bring awareness to the challenges and strengths of people with ADHD.
She says neurodiversity training and workplace adjustments benefit everyone.“People think accommodations need to cost a lot of money.
A lot don’t cost anything at all,” she says.
These adjustments can be software changes that help make screens more readable, providing quiet space where interruptions are limited or observing strict calendar or meeting boundaries to avoid unexpected disruption.
To also believes employers need to stop thinking of these accommodations as favours for workers.
“You’re not giving someone an unfair advantage.
You’re just giving people choice.
And giving people choice means better outcomes.” In the meantime, however, workers with ADHD may be on the back foot, especially if they’re not in an environment with supportive management.As for Christian, he’s secured a new job.
But he’s fully aware he’ll be up against the same challenges he experienced in his last role.
“Ultimately, we live in a world where we're judged by the things that most neurotypical people have an easy time doing, but neurodivergent [people] have a much more challenging time doing,” he says.
“And that's going to be the case whether I'm in manufacturing, or coding or selling.
It doesn't matter.”Christian’s surname is being withheld for job-security concerns

worklife,"When marketing manager Eliza returned from holiday, she received an email from her boss asking her to arrive at work early the next day.
“I instantly feared the worst,” she explains.
“I knew the job wasn’t the best fit.
I’d had my probation previously extended; there was an expectation of weekend working and post-work drinking that didn’t suit me.
I thought he’d used my time off as an opportunity to fire me.”However, when Eliza arrived at her boss’s office, she wasn’t immediately let go.
Instead, she was informed of a company restructure – her job description was being completely rewritten.
Someone else would take over her tasks, and she would be expected to work remotely in a new admin role.
In the weeks that followed, Eliza’s professional life became much quieter.
Instead of formulating the London-based events agency’s marketing strategy from the office or attending live shows as part of her remit, her main duties now consisted of simply being available between 0900 and 1800, sending the occasional email and completing the odd routine task from home.
Eliza had effectively been frozen out by her employer.
Barely a month later, she quit.
“It was humiliating – I was made to feel worthless,” she says.
“It was the worst experience of my career: I’d rather have been just fired on the spot and paid off than have to go through that.”There may not always be a good fit between jobs and the workers hired to do them.
In these cases, companies and bosses may decide they want the worker to depart.
Some may go through formal channels to show employees the door, but others may do what Eliza’s boss did – behave in such a way that the employee chooses to walk away.
Methods may vary; bosses may marginalise workers, make their lives difficult or even set them up to fail.
This can take place over weeks, but also months and years.
Either way, the objective is the same: to show the worker they don’t have a future with the company and encourage them to leave.
In overt cases, this is known as ‘constructive dismissal’: when an employee is forced to leave because the employer created a hostile work environment.
The more subtle phenomenon of nudging employees slowly but surely out of the door has recently been dubbed ‘quiet firing’ (the apparent flipside to ‘quiet quitting’, where employees do their job, but no more).
Rather than lay off workers, employers choose to be indirect and avoid conflict.
But in doing so, they often unintentionally create even greater harm.The path of least resistanceFor myriad reasons, bosses have long tried to nudge workers they perceive as underperforming or being a bad cultural fit out the door.
“This has been happening in workplaces for decades,” says Christopher Kayes, professor of management at the George Washington University School of Business, based in Washington, DC.The reasons for this are complex.
If workers behave in ways that violate their contracts, for example, companies can terminate their employment.
But if bosses simply dislike workers, or see them as middling or mediocre performers, taking action to remove them is more complicated, often requiring lengthy processes involving performance management programmes and multiple warnings.“Companies are usually reluctant to let a worker go,” says Kayes.
Firing leads to an “immediate sense of sides being created” which, at worst, can land the company in court if the worker contests it, potentially generating negative headlines about the working environment.
“It’s often easier to simply let the underperforming employee stay in the job than to go through the process of firing and potential litigation.”Employers often don’t want to expose themselves to risk or conflict, adds Suzanne Horne, partner in employment law at legal firm Paul Hastings, based in London.
“Subtly encouraging someone to leave is seen as the easier option.
If the employee eventually resigns, it’s the ‘no-fault approach’: severance doesn’t need to be paid, conflict is avoided and both parties are ultimately happy.”Managing perceived poor performance, working with the employee to improve their output and turning them into a useful resource for the company would be an alternative way to deal with the problem.
However, Kayes says bosses are often ill-equipped to do this, whether through a lack of time or training.
“Organisations tend to be bad at preparing leaders to take on the responsibilities they’ll need in the job.
So, they often find themselves without the resources they need to be effective and deal with employee underperformance.” In this situation, with firing seen as a last resort and managers unable – or unwilling – to turn the employee into what they want them to be, they often follow the path of least resistance: quiet firing.
“Much of it is ultimately an avoidance behaviour and comes down to procrastination: managers in most cases are wanting to avoid having difficult conversations,” points out Kayes.
“Ironically, they worry that firing a worker will reflect poorly on them, so they quietly fire them instead.”To push out workers, managers may sometimes set up workers to fail with impossible tasks, or take away their jobs altogether (Credit: Getty Images)Why it often backfires By engaging in quiet-firing behaviours, managers are likely to be playing the long game.
In theory, it’s low risk and minimal effort; the hope is that by withdrawing support, the worker soon realises they don’t have a future at the company and moves elsewhere.However, this approach can have collateral damage.
The tactic means firms and managers can end up saddled with workers they don’t want, leading to managers engaging in behaviours often seen as passive-aggressive, says Kayes.
“You stop offering the employee opportunities to advance; you stop inviting them to certain meetings; you stop providing them important work and feedback.” There is also the risk of creating an ‘us and them’ mentality, potentially harming workers not targeted for quiet firing.
“You have the engaged employees, and then those just quietly left there, sometimes without their knowledge,” says Horne.
“It doesn’t create an inclusive or high-performance workplace culture.” Quiet firing can affect a firm’s reputation, too, even if a worker departs without apparent conflict; employees may well share their experience in an online review.
“There’s a greater awareness of employment rights today,” says Horne.
“People are now more willing to call out workplace issues, especially following the pandemic.” An employee subtly nudged out the door isn't without legal recourse, either.
“If you were to look at each individual aspect of quiet firing, there’s likely nothing serious enough to prove an employer breach of contract,” says Horne.
“However, there’s the last-straw doctrine: one final act by the employer which, when added together with past behaviours, can be asserted as constructive dismissal by the employee.”More immediate though, is the mental-health cost to the worker deemed to be expendable by the employer – but who is never directly informed.
“The psychological toll of quiet firing creates a sense of rejection and of being an outcast from their work group.
That can have a huge negative impact on a person’s wellbeing,” says Kayes.
Eliza agrees.
“I was made to feel worthless and useless being quietly fired,” she says.
Now happily employed elsewhere, she’s realised that her experience “was a reflection of having a terrible boss, rather than me”.
But other people who experience quiet firing over the longer term, in more insidious ways, may not see things so clearly.“Over time, an employee may figure out something isn’t right if their one-to-one meetings are always cancelled, their manager never makes time to talk about development and performance or they’re always overlooked for promotion,” says Horne.
“They face a daily drip feed of their employer trying to make them resign – it’s absolutely gruelling.” 'A self-fulfilling prophecy'Quiet firing may be the easiest option on the table for bosses – especially in a remote-work world, where excluding employees is even easier – but it’s not a good solution for firms or workers.“Employers can end up damaging their business’s morale, productivity and culture while risking litigation proceedings anyway,” says Horne.
“For employees, there’s a mental-health impact of feeling excluded, frustrated or angry.
They can lose their confidence and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: their performance declines even further.” Fixing it requires better-resourced managers, greater HR support and the acceptance that workplace confrontation is sometimes best.
However, the time and cost needed to educate managers on how to better motivate employees and deal with difficult situations means that, realistically, quiet firing may be here to stay.
“Training is expensive,” says Kayes.
“It takes huge investment and requires leaders to be open to it; an acceptance that they need to ask themselves hard questions.Human psychology plays its part, too.
Ultimately, quiet firing is the avoidance of difficult emotions.
“There can be the implication that the manager is being nasty or manipulative when they quietly fire an employee, but there is a person on either side of the table,” says Horne.
“And people generally like to avoid hard conversations.” Eliza is using one name for career-security reasons

worklife,"Helen hasn’t spoken with her son in more than a year.
The last she heard, he was in prison.
Now aged 31, he’s been addicted to opioids for more than a decade.“He’s tried to call me, probably to ask for money, and I have not been picking up,” explains Helen, who lives in England.
“Right now, that’s the right decision for my safety and sanity.” As the primary caregiver for her son’s young daughter, Helen’s focus is providing a loving and secure environment for her to grow up in.Helen remembers her son as an impulsive and destructive child, but with a wicked sense of humour and a kind heart.
So, she was confused when, as a teenager, “his behaviour turned hostile and he started locking himself in the toilet for hours at a time”, she recalls.
“When I confronted him, he’d tell me I was the mad one, the one on drugs.
Sometimes, I wanted to laugh, it was so ridiculous.” When Helen found out he was using heroin, she didn’t know where to turn.
He would disappear for days, returning with all kinds of injuries.
When he was at home, he was difficult to be around.
“He never hit me, but would often destroy the flat in anger – there’s still a hole in the corridor where he kneed it,” she explains.At work, she was paid in cash, which she says her son began taking from her wallet.
Not wanting to say anything in case he got violent, she began keeping the money in a belt around her waist.
“I said my earnings were going straight into an account so I could get a better credit rating,” she says.
She ultimately felt unsafe living with someone deep in an addiction, and cut contact with him.The relationship between a parent and their child is expected to be lifelong – a fruitful, loving bond that can survive any highs and lows.
However, for some parents, maintaining this connection can be difficult.
Eventually, a parent might feel they have reached a point of no return, and so choose to step away from their role.Some parents who decide to sever ties say they do so for their own health and safety (Credit: Getty Images)In an increasingly polarised world, conversations about children who stop speaking to their parents have become common.
Yet it also happens the other way around, even if the discourse is less frequent.
This may be in part because data indicates parents severing ties with their children is rarer: a 2015 study conducted by the British estrangement charity Stand Alone showed that 5% of estranged parents had initiated it themselves.The decision is already difficult and painful, and those who experience this estrangement say its relative rarity makes it especially isolating, and can add to stigma for those who choose to pursue this path.‘Unconditional love can be problematic’“In both research and popular culture, we rarely hear from parents who estrange themselves from their children because it’s so taboo, and there are very few non-judgemental places to speak openly about the experience,” explains Lucy Blake, a senior lecturer in psychology at University of the West England, Bristol, who specialises in estrangement.The reasons parents end relationships with their children are similar to the reasons kids cut off their parents: according to Blake, among the most common cited are family conflict, differences in personal values (such as religious beliefs), substance abuse and other toxic behaviour.
The Stand Alone research showed that for relationship breakdowns with sons, issues linked to divorce, in-laws and marriage were the most widely reported drivers; while with daughters, mental-health problems and emotional abuse were more common.Yet this decision to fracture with children tends to be far more trying and ultimately difficult.
Societally, parents are expected to cherish and care for offspring without exception.
“We have very high, almost godlike expectations of a parent, where we want them to be unconditionally loving,” explains Blake.
“This can be quite problematic, as it suggests they should accept any kind of treatment, including all kinds of psychological and financial abuse.”This is perhaps why, even when their children are hurting them, parents struggle to let go.
Jennifer Storey, a psychology lecturer at the University of Kent, UK, who specialises in interpersonal violence, finds that in most of her interviews with victims of elder abuse, parents are still worried and sad for their children.
“I am struggling to remember one parent who really wanted to cut their child off – they almost always wanted the relationship to continue, but the abuse to end,” she explains.It can also be hard for both them and the people around them to accept the reality of what’s happening.
“Parents are assumed to have all the power, but as the child grows older, that power dynamic shifts,” says Amanda Holt, author of the book Adolescent-to-Parent Abuse: Current Understandings in Research, Policy and Practice.
“The lack of belief that child-parent abuse can happen, or that it can be so bad a parent needs to leave, is another reason that it’s so difficult to walk away.”The “intergenerational stake hypothesis” may also be at work.
This theory suggests that parents are typically more invested – emotionally, financially and physically – in the parent-child relationship than their children.
Greater positive ties with children are associated with a parent’s improved wellbeing, a greater quality of life and lower depressive symptoms; greater positive ties with a parent do not guarantee the same benefits.
This means that the parent’s choice to sever contact with a child, whether abruptly or gradually, doesn’t just come with the weight of failure.“Parenthood is a role and identity that’s respected and admired – it’s also life-changing and lifelong,” explains Blake.
“When a parent does not have an active relationship with their child, they might feel they have failed in this role, bringing feelings of intense pain and shame, changing or challenging how parents think about themselves and who they are.”Given these elements, it can be more challenging for parents to sever ties than it is for children.
“It could certainly be a different kind of pain, because for parents, there’s the possibility that their life seems emptier or less meaningful,” says Blake.
Many will lose friendships and relationships with other family members as a result.
“The loss and pain that accompanies estrangement ripples out to touch many different aspects of people’s lives,” says Blake.Estrangement from a child can be an extremely lonely ordeal, and damage relationships with friends and family alike (Credit: Getty Images)This story is part of BBC's Family Tree series, which examines the issues and opportunities parents, children and families face today – and how they'll shape the world tomorrow.
Find more on BBC Future.Murky and muddledIn some cases, like Helen’s, the decision to cut off contact is clearly made by one party.
But the source of estrangement between parents and children can often be more muddled.Jack, who lives in the US, was married to his wife for nearly two decades, during which time they had four children together.
At the time of the divorce, their youngest daughter was a year old.
When his ex-wife remarried, he says, his youngest child gravitated more towards her stepfather than him – and as she grew older, seemed not to enjoy spending time with Jack.Jack says he reached a breaking point during a visitation when his daughter was aged 14.
After a disagreement about curfew, she told Jack she hated her weekends with him, and called her mother for a ride to the event she had planned to attend.
“I emailed my ex to say it appeared [my daughter] no longer wanted to spend every other weekend’s visitation with me, and if that were to change in the future, she would be welcomed back with open arms,” says Jack.
He doesn’t blame his daughter for acting as she did, but hasn’t heard from or seen her since.
Although his daughter cut off contact initially, Jack hasn’t felt the need to re-kindle contact with her directly.
“The longer it has drawn out, it’s lessened my need to re-establish this relationship.
It feels similar to a death to me, and I have moved on,” he says.
“At this stage of my life, with the comfort level I enjoy in the relationships I have, I doubt I would be interested in the time needed to invest in building a meaningful relationship with her, not to mention the drama from her that would come with that,” he explains.Jack’s story reflects the murky reality of parent-child estrangement, which is that it’s not always cut-and-dried who drops whom.
His daughter made her disinterest in him apparent, but he was the one to actually suggest they stop seeing one another.
This isn’t an uncommon situation, say experts: “For some estranged parents, there’s no one clear answer on who initiated it, and it’s quite messy,” says Blake.
When asked who initiated the estrangement (with the options of “they did”, “I did”, “we cut contact with one another” and “I’m not sure”), 10% of respondents in Stand Alone’s community study chose one or more responses, showing that the direction is not always clear.Estrangement is also not always a permanent or static state.
Moving through periods of estrangement and reunification is common, especially, as Stand Alone found, for mothers and daughters.
This is also the case for many parents whose child has an addiction.
A 2020 Swedish study showed parents of adult drug addicts remained hopeful about an eventual reconciliation, in part because they were able to see their child as two different people: one sober, and one under the influence.
If the latter were to leave, as it were, the relationship could continue.Helen, for her part, has severed contact with her son several times – they have cycled through periods of estrangement and reconciliation for years.
But for now, she is out of touch with him – and unsure what will come next.
“If he could show me he was committed to staying clean and out of jail, perhaps I’d want him back in our life,” she explains.
“But I don’t know how I could ever trust him again, and certainly not to care for his little one.” ‘A lonely ordeal’Even for the parents who are steadfast in their reasoning for initiating a break-up, the day-to-day reality of their decision is far from easy.
“Configured through biological, legal and social bonds, there is an attachment with one’s child that is very profound,” explains Holt.
“Such that if parents do walk away, the relationship may be gone but those bonds persist.
It can be very difficult to leave all of that behind.”Many parents who initiate estrangement find that the shame and blame surrounding their decision also leads to acute isolation, and ruptures with their established support network even beyond blood relatives.
“Parents who have initiated estrangement have very few [people] they can talk to who will show compassion and understanding,” explains Blake.
“There might be some room for talking about feelings of grief and loss, but it’s as if it runs out and people are expected to get over it and get on with life.”Jack has fielded discussions with friends who don’t understand his non-relationship with his daughter and say they could never turn their back on a blood relation.
“To me, just because someone is ‘blood’ does not give them the right to treat [you] poorly,” he explains.Compassion and a space to talk may be particularly important at specific moments throughout the calendar year – and this time frame is different for every parent.
Wounds feel rawer during the holidays in particular: according to Stand Alone, 90% of people estranged from a family member find holiday seasons challenging, while 85% struggle with the passing of birthdays and 81% find it difficult to be around other families.For her part, Helen is feeling particularly reflective as Christmas approaches and she shows her granddaughter the Christmas lights.
It was something she often did with her son, and she wishes they could share this together.
“I was the only lifeline he had, and dealing with my choice to step away never gets easier,” she says.
She feels lucky that her daughter has been so supportive, and six months ago, Helen moved closer to her place so they could see one another regularly.
“Without the help and understanding of my daughter, I don’t know where I’d be, as this has been a very lonely ordeal,” she says.
“The best I can do is keep myself well so I can do the same for others – I’m trying to take it day by day.”

worklife,"In the TV series The Good Place, the character Chidi Anagonye is defined by his inability to make even the simplest of decisions – from choosing what to eat, to proclaiming love for his soulmate.
The very idea of making a choice often results in a serious stomach-ache.
He is stuck in continued ‘analysis paralysis’.
We meet Chidi in the afterlife, and learn that his indecisiveness was the cause of his death.
While standing in the street, endlessly equivocating on which bar to visit with his best friend, an air-conditioning unit from the apartment above falls on his head, killing him instantly.
“You know the sound that a fork makes in the garbage disposal?
That's the sound my brain makes all the time,” he says in one episode.
And besides making himself unhappy, Chidi’s lack of confidence in his own judgements drives the people around him crazy.
If that sounds like an exaggerated version of you, then you are not alone: indecisiveness is a common trait.
While some people come to very quick judgements, others struggle to weigh up the options – and may even try to avoid making a choice at all.
As Chidi shows, indecisiveness can be linked to problems like anxiety, yet recent research suggests that it can also have an upside – it protects us from common cognitive errors like confirmation bias, so that when the person does finally come to a judgement, it is generally wiser than those who jumped to a conclusion too quickly.
The trick is to learn when to wait, and when to break through the inertia while it’s holding you back.
The enemy of good Psychologists have various tools to measure indecisiveness.
One of the most common questionnaires – the Frost Indecisiveness Scale – asks participants to rate a series of statements on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).
They include: Using this scale, psychologists have shown that indecisiveness is often a product of perfectionism.
Perfectionists are scared of the shame or regret that may come with making the wrong choice – and so they put off making decisions until they feel certain they are doing the right thing.
(And in some cases, of course, they simply never reach that level of confidence.)
The frustration this brings can be a barrier to happiness; in general, the higher someone scores on the scale above, the lower they will score on measures of life satisfaction, according to a study by Eric Rassin, a professor of psychology at Erasmus University, in the Netherlands.
They are less likely to endorse statements such as “the conditions of my life are excellent”, for example, or “if I could live my life over, I would change almost nothing”.Indecision is often perceived as a negative trait - but there may be surprising advantages to taking your time (Credit: Getty)Jumping to conclusions From these results, indecisiveness would seem like a wholly undesirable trait.
Recent research, however, suggests that the struggle to come to a quick conclusion – as uncomfortable as it may be – can also have an upside, since it protects people from some important cognitive biases.
Evidence for these benefits comes from a recent paper by Jana-Maria Hohnsbehn, a doctoral researcher, and Iris Schneider, a professor of social psychology, at the TU Dresden (Technische Universität Dresden).
Rather than using the Frost Indecisiveness Scale, Hohnsbehn and Schneider focused on a measure of “trait ambivalence”, which looks more specifically at the thoughts and feelings underlying someone’s judgement and decision-making (or lack thereof).
For example, people are asked to rate statements such as: “If these statements resonate with us, then we are probably high in trait ambivalence,” says Hohnsbehn.
As you might expect, those high in trait ambivalence take a longer time to make decisions.
But Hohnsbehn and Schneider found that they are also less prone to bias when coming to their judgements.
For example, in one experiment, she asked her participants to read a series of scenarios, such as: You meet a person, and you would like to find out whether he/she is an introvert or extrovert.
You guess that the person is an extrovert.
Which of the following two questions would you ask?
Many people pick the second question, but this is a sign of confirmation bias – you are only looking for the information that agrees with your assumption, rather than looking for evidence that you may be wrong.
Hohnsbehn and her colleagues found that people with high trait ambivalence were less likely to do this.
Instead, they chose to interrogate their assumption, in order to make sure they had the information they needed to come to a correct answer.
For another experiment, the participants read about an employee, Mr Müller, who was seeking to get his contract renewed.
After making a preliminary decision about whether to allow Mr Müller to continue in the role, the participants were given some additional statements, which were ostensibly from industry experts about Mr Müller.
Some of these statements agreed with the participants’ initial decisions, while others disagreed.
The participants’ task was to rate the credibility and importance of each one.
Hohnsbehn and Schneider found that the people scoring high on ambivalence tended to be more open-minded to the statements that disagreed with their initial point of view, and rated them more highly for their credibility and importance – whereas those who showed little trait ambivalence were more likely to discount them.
These findings are important, since confirmation bias is one of our most common cognitive errors, preventing us from analysing evidence rationally in everything from our personal relationships to our political views.
Trait ambivalence helps protect us from this kind of oversimplistic thinking – and may also help us with other forms, too.
Studies by Schneider, for instance, suggest that people with high trait ambivalence are also less prone to “correspondence bias”, which is a tendency to ignore the context of someone’s behaviour and to instead attribute any failures and successes directly to the person themselves.
To give a straightforward example: if someone slips over, correspondence bias might lead us to conclude that they are inherently clumsy (an internal factor), rather than recognising the slipperiness of the floor (an external factor).
Correspondence bias might also lead us to assume that someone struggling in their education simply lacks intelligence, rather than considering the strains of their financial difficulties or their responsibilities within the family.
People with high trait ambivalence are more likely to recognise those other factors than people who form quick and confident judgements.Indecision is only a problem when it becomes excessive, experts say (Credit: Getty)Action over inaction Hohnsbehn’s research should be good news if you’ve ever felt impatient with your inability to come to a quick decision.
“The general experience of being ambivalent needs to be embraced,” she suggests.
“It can give us necessary pause, signalling to us that things are complex and that we need more time to engage in more careful thought about our decision.” It is only when this becomes excessive that we face problems.
“As with most things, there is a balance that needs to be struck,” adds Hohnsbehn.
That might explain why indecisive people often score lower on those measures of life satisfaction – their ambivalence, when facing important choices, has become overwhelming.
One simple step might be to set a time limit for your final decision so that you do not spend too much time ruminating on the different options without actually gaining any new insights.
Depending on the type of problem you are facing, Hohnsbehn suggests you might even consider turning it into a series of tasks – such as devoting two hours to the search for new information, for example, before spending a certain amount of time deliberating.
If you still feel paralysed, you might find inspiration in a study by Steven Levitt, an economist at the University of Chicago, which examined people’s overall happiness after making important life changes.
Levitt, who is a co-author of the book Freakonomics, set up a website where people described various dilemmas they were facing in their lives – from getting a tattoo to moving house, returning to education or quitting their jobs.
The participants were then asked to flip a coin, the outcome of which would tell them whether or not to make the change.
Following up with the participants over the following months, Levitt found many people had taken the plunge; if the coin toss had told them to take action, they were more likely to make the life change.
And they reported being significantly happier than those who had simply carried on as before (regardless of whether the coin had told them to or not), without quitting, moving or getting that tattoo.
We can guess that, before the study, most of these participants had already been thinking carefully about the situation at hand, but their worries about making the wrong choice had prevented them from taking the plunge.
The coin had simply acted as a small nudge to finally overcome their ambivalence.
The moral of the study, then, is not that we should make all decisions on the whim of a tossed coin.
It is that breaking through your hesitancy and doubt will leave you happier than you might imagine.
“A good rule of thumb in decision making is, whenever you cannot decide what you should do, choose the action that represents a change, rather than continuing the status quo,” concluded Levitt.
Like Chidi in The Good Place, we can weigh up all the pros and cons of every situation – and that ambivalence will help us to make wiser choices.
Once that ambivalent thinking has served its purpose, however, you must learn to cast it aside – safe in the knowledge that any decision is often better than making no choice at all.David Robson is a science writer and author of The Expectation Effect: How Your Mindset Can Transform Your Life, published by Canongate (UK) and Henry Holt (USA) in early 2022.

worklife,"As 2022 comes to a close, we're bringing back our favourite pieces of the year.
See the rest of our Best of Worklife 2022 collection for more great reads.Davis Nguyen specialises in helping college seniors begin a career in management consulting.
It’s an industry that historically pays well: even before the pandemic, some of the biggest firms offered undergraduates salaries that often approached the six-figure mark.
However, in the current market, Nguyen’s clients are doing particularly well.
“They’ll come back and say ‘I have two great offers’,” explains the founder of My Consulting Offer, based in Georgia, US.
“One is for $120,000 (£91,630), the other is for $140,000 (£106,900).
Today’s climate means graduates can earn much more money than a few years ago.”Management consulting is among the sectors in which graduates are increasingly walking straight from the lecture hall into six-figure roles – earning pay packets most people will never see in their lifetimes.
In Big Tech, entry-level software engineers are often starting on such wages.
At the largest banking corporations, pay for first-year analysts has spiked nearly 30% – a $110,000 (£83,979) base salary, in some cases.
At the biggest London law firms, some newly qualified solicitors begin their careers on a £107,500 salary ($141,115).
Nguyen says “20-year-olds earning $100,000 from the get-go” has increasingly become the norm since the pandemic.Often, these young employees are joining firms where colleagues began with lower pay, and had to work hard for years to earn six figures.
Such organisations would argue it’s a response to market needs: the hiring crisis means the competition for talent remains fierce; if an employer wants the best candidates willing to put in long hours, they have to pay a high price for them.However, beyond matching the market rate, does offering graduates huge pay packets actually bring benefits, like incentivising longer hours or boosting work ethic?
Or can it create unintended consequences, for both the young high-earner as well as the wider workforce?‘High pay is an expectation’ Wages for graduates have been steadily rising for years.
According to 2021 data from US non-profit the National Association of Colleges and Employers, the starting salary for some entry-level workers in particular fields has spiked dramatically: for example, the average wage for a computer-science major has risen to $72,173 (£55,100) – a 7% hike in just one year.Nicholas Bloom, professor of economics at Stanford University, says demand for labour is fast outstripping supply in sectors, particularly in tech.
The financial industry – with jobs that often require 70-hour-plus workweeks – has also driven up starting salaries to hire the best candidates.
So, in most cases, graduates are being handed six-figure salaries simply as a “blunt recruitment tool” amid the current labour market conditions, adds Rue Dooley, an HR knowledge advisor for the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), based in the US.“Workers want to be thought of as a prized asset by their employer,” says Dooley.
“Younger employees are saying high pay is an expectation not because they necessarily demand it, but because they’re aware of the talent shortage and they know their price.” This means some entry-level workers can secure huge pay packets before they’ve even left the college dorm.
“We’re regularly seeing firms double in size every 18 months, so graduate salaries are closely following the market,” adds Bloom.In tech, smaller start-ups are also now having to pay entry-level employees higher salaries to match the more-established corporations.
Josh Brenner, CEO of recruitment marketplace Hired, based in New York City, says US employers are paying first-year tech workers an average starting salary of $110,027 (£84,000).
Nguyen’s undergrad clients often land jobs with wages that dwarf the pay of his own first management consulting role.
He believes it to be a good thing.
“The six-figure starting salaries of today are an upward trend that stretches back decades,” he says.
“High pay opens up opportunities for people who simply wouldn’t otherwise have had them, and it doesn’t take money away from those who started on lower pay.”In sectors including law, consulting, finance and computer science, graduates are snagging pay packets many people will never earn in their lives (Credit: Getty Images)Golden handcuffs – and other problemsBut while there are many upsides to the rise of six-figure salaries, these high compensation packets can come with insidious consequences.In some cases, these workers may find themselves trapped in jobs they hate, especially if workers have built lifestyles around earning big pay-outs – a phenomenon often called ‘golden handcuffs’.Nguyen says such wages can also skew young employees’ perception of pay, blocking them from pursuing more meaningful career paths.
“Some may want to eventually move into teaching or work for a non-profit.
Previously, the salary drop was around $50,000.
Now, it’s closer to $100,000 – that could be enough to prevent someone from changing careers.”Huge salaries can also weigh young employees with a psychological burden.
Nguyen says some of his undergraduate clients can feel intimidated beginning their working lives in a job that pays a fortune.
“There are some who come from low-income backgrounds and think, ‘What did I do to earn so much more than my parents ever made?’ It can cause imposter syndrome.” Others in the same organisations can also feel negative effects when first-time employees are handed six-figure salaries without hesitation.
For example, experienced colleagues may bristle at entry-level compensation packets – especially when they take home less money than a recent graduate, despite years-long tenure at the company.
“It can create pay disparity issues,” says Dooley.Additionally, companies themselves may not necessarily get what they pay for.
While sky-high wages can effectively ‘buy’ a candidate’s willingness to regularly clock unpaid overtime, it doesn’t necessarily guarantee better work ethic.“The risk is employers, in some cases, assume staff are going to be super motivated because of their high compensation, but in fact they take it for granted,” says Tomas Chamorro, professor of business psychology at University College London.
“High wages may feel good when someone gets a job, but once they start, they typically want much more: the effects of good pay will be psychologically ‘spent’.” 'Jobs to grab while you can'With the labour market as it is, six-figure starting salaries will probably continue to be the norm in certain high-paying industries.
But it’s unlikely there’ll be much of a trickle-down effect for entry-level workers in less elite sectors.Rather than push wages up across the board, six-figure salaries for an ultra-privileged subset of employees may instead drive pay inequities deeper.
“What we’re seeing is clearly increasing inequality and the gap keeps growing,” says Bloom.
“If you have a computer-science degree you can be earning $250,000 by 25, while if you left school at 16 you might be earning $25,000 – a ten-fold difference.”The gap will likely keep growing even if the labour market snaps back in terms of supply and demand.
Bloom explains while wages often rise, they almost never fall.
For example, Nguyen says salaries in management consulting have long endured the rigours of recession.
“We’ve seen wages withstand so many economic cycles: firms plan for it and restructure pay, but they wouldn’t ever get rid of the six-figure salary.”So, given their resistance to the ebb and flow of the market, six-figure graduate wages are not only likely to become more and more ingrained, they may also climb further.
And if jobs become scarcer due to a labour-market normalisation, these pay packets will become increasingly out of reach for most people.
“Six-figure starting salaries are here to stay, and if growth cools it'll mean they’ll be even harder to come by,” says Bloom.
“These are jobs to grab while you can – if you can – for a privileged few.”

worklife,"As 2022 comes to a close, we're bringing back our favourite pieces of the year.
See the rest of our Best of Worklife 2022 collection for more great reads.After Chris, 35, came out as bisexual three years ago, he decided that he “didn’t necessarily want to live a heteronormative life”.
“I wanted to be able to date men and women simultaneously for my whole life,” says Chris, who is withholding his surname for privacy.
“I felt like monogamy would deny me something of myself.”During the pandemic, Chris moved into an intentional, sex-positive community in Brooklyn, New York – a “safe space” where he could further explore his relationship with sex and sexuality.
Through that community, he discovered a course called Open Smarter, which guided students through navigating various types of ethically non-monogamous relationships.
That’s where he first heard the term ‘solo polyamory’.
He quickly felt like it fit his dating style.At its core, solo polyamory refers to people who are open to dating or engaging in multiple meaningful relationships without having a ‘primary partner’: one person to whom they’re committed above all other partners.
Instead, the solo polyamorist might see themselves as their own primary partner, eschewing typical relationship goals, like merging finances or homes with a partner, and getting married and having children.
Solo polyamorists represent a small portion of polyamorists in general, many of whom tend to have or aim to have a primary partner, says Philadelphia-based sex educator and therapist Liz Powell, 39, so it’s inherently difficult to figure out what percentage of the overall population is engaging in relationships this way.
However, some studies show younger generations are more likely to have entered into some kind of non-monogamous relationship than older generations.
Per a 2020 YouGov survey of 1,300 US adults, 43% of millennials said that their ideal relationship would be non-monogamous, while just 30% of Gen X said the same.
Overall, research from 2016 synthesising two different US studies showed 20% of respondents engaged in a consensually non-monogamous relationship at some point.
But these studies don’t break down those numbers by specific types of non-monogamous relationships, so it’s impossible to say how many of those surveyed identify with solo polyamory.Since solo polyamorists are a minority identity, misconceptions about their lifestyles abound.
From people who equate solo polyamory to monogamists dating around until they find “the one”, to those who consider it a selfish or greedy move, like “having your cake and eating it, too”, there’s a tendency to overlook the term’s more nuanced definition.
Ultimately, it boils down to stepping off what’s known as the heteronormative “relationship escalator”, and opting for an alternative way to engage in romantic and sexual partnerships.For many solo polyamorists, the identity enables them to explore different sexual desires and experiences without adhering to heteronormative expectations (Credit: Getty Images)The “relationship escalator”The term solo polyamory gained popularity with the blog Solopoly.net, written by journalist Amy Gahran, under the pen name Aggie Sez.
Her first blog post, published in 2012, was titled, “Riding the relationship escalator (or not)”.
About five years later, she wrote a book on the subject, Stepping Off the Relationship Escalator: Uncommon Love and Life.Gahran defines this ‘escalator’ as “the default set of societal customs for the proper conduct of intimate relationships” – in other words, relationships that hit, or aim to hit, traditional life markers, like moving in with a partner, merging finances, getting engaged, getting married and having children.“We have these normalised benchmarks or signs that a relationship is serious,” says California-based Rachel Krantz, 34, author of Open: An Uncensored Memoir of Love, Liberation, and Non-Monogamy – A Polyamory Memoir.
“Solo polyamorous people tend to avoid intertwining their life in that way with someone else.” Though the definition may seem narrow, there are plenty of ways to be ‘solo poly’.
Solo polyamorous folks tend to be allosexual, says Colorado-based Elisabeth Sheff, author of books including The Polyamorists Next Door, meaning they tend to experience sexual desire – but some are asexual and maintain multiple, non-sexual relationships.
They also tend to “value their independence”, adds Sheff, but some have very important, non-romantic relationships in their lives that they put first.
“The single parent who prioritises their children over all other relationships could be solo poly,” says Sheff, as could someone who’s the caretaker of a person with a disability.Solo polyamory also doesn’t have to be forever.
One could identify as solo poly today, but still wind up entering a more traditional relationship with a shared home or finances in the future – it doesn’t have to be a fixed identity to be valid, says New York-based sex researcher and consultant Zhana Vrangalova.Chris, in fact, expresses interest in one day finding a primary partner, but says in the meantime being solo poly “allows me to date, have experiences with people, get to know a lot of different people, and have some of my needs met”.
It’s similar to when he was dating around monogamously, he adds, “except now I’ve put a label on it to communicate to people what my intentions are”.Vrangalova, who’s originally from Macedonia, teaches the Open Smarter course that Chris attended in New York.
She estimates about two-thirds of her class are people in relationships, and slightly more than half of those are in monogamous relationships but “trying to figure out if some version of non-monogamy would be right for them”.
The rest are either already exploring various forms of non-monogamy and seeking out more skills to help them better navigate those relationships, or they’re single and looking for relationships.
Solo polyamory is not right for everyone.
Vrangalova has her students take personality quizzes to help them determine the relationship style(s) that might work best for them.
These quizzes ask questions like “how much adventure and novelty” respondents need, or how much security they require in their relationships.
Solo polyamorists, says Vrangalova, “usually don't need a lot of relational security”.However, just because someone who identifies as solo poly may not need the same level of security as someone in a long-term, monogamous partnership, this doesn’t mean they can’t or won’t form deep, lasting bonds with partners.
To foster trusting relationships with her partners, sex-educator Powell, who identifies as solo poly, says they’re very upfront with potential partners about their wants and needs.
“I'm not going to not ask for [what I want in a relationship] just because I’m worried that you're going to say no,” they say.
“If people say no, they say no, and we figure out where to go from there.”The antidote to “couple privilege”?A lot of the stigmas surrounding solo polyamory come from a general lack of understanding of why someone might not want a so-called “serious”, traditional relationship.
Stereotypes of solo poly people include them being “selfish, avoidant or [messed] up in various ways”, says Vrangalova.
Furthermore, solo polyamory is marked by its lack of adherence to relationship benchmarks like marriage and children – which also serve as benchmarks of adulthood.
“The people we consider to be ‘adults’ are married with kids, sharing houses, sharing finances,” says Powell.
“Whereas ‘wayward adults’, like myself, who live alone, unmarried, are examples of everything wrong with society.”Of course, adults can very successfully live on their own and be self-sufficient.
For those who identify as solo poly, it also doesn’t mean they “don’t care about people”, says Sheff.
“They just don't want to organise their life centrally around a romantic partner.”Even though someone identifies as solo poly, they can still form meaningful one-to-one relationships with partners (Credit: Getty Images)These prejudices exist alongside another societal force known as “couple privilege”.
This wide-reaching phrase refers both to the advantages couples have in society over singles (like the financial benefits of marriage and couplehood) and the attitude that, for instance, in a polyamorous relationship, the success of the primary couple must be prioritised.
All other partners’ actions must be taken with preserving that primary relationship in mind.These stigmas and societal expectations can present roadblocks for people who identify as solo poly.
When Powell was in a polyamorous relationship in Savannah, Georgia, US, around 2014, they tried to find a non-monogamy-affirming therapist, to no avail.
That prompted them to fill the void, and Powell opened their own private practice targeting people who identified as non-monogamous, queer, kinky and/or trans.Even in psychology circles, there remains a dearth of knowledge about polyamory, let alone solo polyamory.
Sheff is part of Division 44, a subgroup of the American Psychological Association working to develop educational materials about polyamory for counsellors and therapists.More than just dating aroundUltimately, solo polyamory is much more than a way to date multiple partners while living alone.
It’s a rejection of heteronormative relationship standards.“For me, a lot of solo polyamory has been about finding ways that I centre my own autonomy, the autonomy of others and genuinely question which things I want in a relationship, rather than assuming that every relationship was going to follow the escalator,” says Powell.Chris was similarly attracted to the solo poly label because it let him think about and approach relationships differently.
He says the relationship pathways he grew up with didn’t make sense for him; before gay marriage was legalised in the US, he was having sexual relationships with people he knew he’d never be able to wed. Today, Chris says he wouldn’t 100% rule out the prospect of marriage, but he’s not exactly a fan of the institution.
“As a queer, bisexual person, I don't like that heteronormative structure of marriage,” he says.
“I want to rebel against that.”

worklife,"As 2022 comes to a close, we're bringing back our favourite pieces of the year.
See the rest of our Best of Worklife 2022 collection for more great reads.Dedeker Winston has been in non-monogamous relationships for more than a decade, yet she has never seen such keen interest in open relationships.The subject has traditionally been very taboo in many places, including the US, where Winston is based.
In 2014, when she started the Multiamory podcast, she and her co-producers had to decide whether to use their real names on the ethnical non-monogamy show.
“At that point, there was pretty much only one or two other podcasts actually broaching this subject,” says the dating coach.
“And the people who were producing and hosting those podcasts used pseudonyms.” But things have changed.
Around 2016, Winston noticed a real “explosion of interest around non-monogamy”, about a year after she started work as a dating coach specialising in those types of relationships.
“That was when I feel like I saw the biggest turning point, of all of a sudden so many people online being willing to talk about being non-monogamous,” she says, “and to express the fact that they have an interest in these sorts of things.”Sarah Levinson, a counsellor at Creative Relating Psychology Psychotherapy in New York City, who specialises in sexuality and relationship dynamics, has also noticed an increasing interest in open relationships within the past decade.
“It was much more obscure 10 years ago, and now it's incredibly common,” she says.
These accounts as well as some data show a growing interest in consensually non-monogamous relationships, including open relationships.
Experts say many societal and cultural factors that have led to a wider embrace of non-traditional relationship styles, and the pandemic may even be playing a part.
But while interest in open relationships may be climbing, experts are mixed on how wide their uptake may actually be – at least for right now.
'Free passes' and swingingThere are many ways to engage in non-monogamy, says Levinson.
“It could be anything from living with multiple partners and sharing finances, or it could be supporting your partner in once a year having a free pass at a work conference out of state to have a hook-up.”Open relationships fall under the non-monogamy umbrella, but many tend to differentiate between those types of arrangements and other types of non-monogamy, like polyamory.
Polyamory often means participating in multiple intimate partnerships, while open relationships are more often associated with people engaging in primarily sexual relationships outside of their prioritised, two-person partnership.
In other words, open relationships are less focused on emotional connections with people outside a primary relationship, and more on sexual ones.Open relationships are generally associated with people engaging in primarily sexual relationships outside of their prioritised, two-person partnership (Credit: Getty Images)For some, this means going on casual dates and having ‘friends-with-benefits’-type relationships with people other than their primary partners.
For others, an open relationship just means that occasional “free pass” to have a one-night stand or brief sexual fling.
And for others still, the arrangement could look more like swinging – such as having sex with other couples as a couple, but not going on dates separately.
Winston also brings up “don’t ask, don’t tell”-style open relationships, in which both members of a couple permit the other to have sexual relations with other people – they just don’t want to discuss those experiences together.Other terms, like “monogamish”, which US-based relationship and sex columnist Dan Savage popularised several years ago, can overlap definitionally with some of these open-relationship arrangements.
Savage has discussed his monogamish relationship on his podcast, in which he and his partner are committed to each other, but still have non-committal sex with other men.
People of all stripes are engaging in open relationships.
Over the past few years, Levinson says she’s been seeing “quite a bit of diversity” among those participating in open relationships in her sessions, in terms of everything from “economic resources” to “ethnicity”.
(However, she acknowledges that as a counsellor working in New York City, she gets to see a different sample than one might come across in other more conservative parts of the US.)
Among Winston’s client base, podcast listeners and website visitors, she’s found many who are interested or participating in open relationships tend to skew relatively young – between the ages of 25 and 45.
And many identify as queer, bisexual and/or pansexual.
However, in her practice, she’s worked with clients interested in or practicing open relationships who are as young as 19 and as old as in their 70s.
“The people who come to my door completely span the spectrum,” she says.‘Getting curious’ Dating-app trends help highlight the rise in interest in open relationships.
For one, there has been an emergence of platforms particularly focused on non-monogamy, including open relationships, to cater to rising curiosity.
But even more traditional dating apps, such as OkCupid, have seen a spike in interest in open relationships.
“While the majority of OkCupid daters seek monogamous relationships, in 2021, users seeking non-monogamous relationships increased 7%,” an OkCupid representative told BBC Worklife.
Among more than 1 million UK-based OkCupid users who responded to the question, ‘Would you consider having an open relationship?’ in the app, 31% percent said yes in 2022, compared to 29% in 2021 and 26% in 2020.Additionally, 2022 data from dating app Hinge showed one in five Hinge users “would consider” trying out an open relationship, while one in 10 have already engaged in one.
Hinge’s director of relationship science Logan Ury says there may be a pandemic effect, since she believes it was “the perfect opportunity to pause and think more about what we want.”Counsellors and professionals including Levinson and Winston have also observed an uptick.
Winston says that much of the recent interest she’s seen in open relationships comes from millennials who are simply “questioning the way they’ve been raised” – in most cases, to believe that long-term, married monogamy is the end goal of intimate relationships.This may stem from an overall trend towards open mindedness, believes Levinson.
“Societally, we are all more open minded to all sorts of identities that are less conventional… people are more willing to challenge societal constructs in a general way.” This has opened the door for people to question their own desires, too.
When “you keep choosing monogamy and it's not working… you start getting curious about [whether] there’s another way”.And for those who are curious, there are more resources than ever.
Along with the “explosion of interest” in open relationships, adds Winston, there’s an “explosion in content creators and people writing about it in media… in apps, in community meetups”.
This means information about non-monogamy is widely accessible – not in “old, dusty LiveJournals [personal online journals]  in the corners of the internet”, which is where Winston says she needed to look for information more than a decade ago.
More fantasy than reality?Despite more people embracing non-monogamous arrangements, and a rising visibility around open relationships, the general perception still leans negative.
“Research and public opinion polls suggest that attitudes toward consensual non-monogamy are mostly negative overall, although they appear to have trended more positive in recent years,” says Dr Justin Lehmiller, Kinsey Institute research fellow and host of the Sex and Psychology Podcast.
While those negative attitudes may not stop people from thinking about being in open relationships, it can deter them from engaging in them.
In his research about sexual fantasies, for instance, Lehmiller has found that “most people have fantasised about being non-monogamous in some way before, such as by participating in swinging, opening up their relationship or being polyamorous”.
However, he adds, “relatively few are practising it in real life”.
Although there is no post-pandemic data on how many people are in these arrangements, Canadian research from 2019 puts the figure at about 4%, with a similar figure emerging in a 2018 US study.Even if an increasing number of people are engaging in open relationships, the subject may remain taboo, say some experts (Credit: Getty Images)Levinson believes this may in part stem from an entrenched perception that open relationships are broadly seen as ‘unhealthy’.
Among her therapist colleagues, Levinson has observed that plenty still view the “dyad” or “couple bubble” as the “only workable way of having a secure attachment”, she says.
She feels these attitudes can “cut into people feeling like this is a viable option for them”.
Religious beliefs can also deter people from engaging in sexual and/or dating relationships with more than one person at a time, as can the cultural norms of certain communities.
Even so, Winston sees people, particularly millennials and Gen Z, continuing to move away from the idea that one partner can fulfil all their needs (something the traditionally monogamous concept of marriage encourages).
She points to more platonic friends deciding to live together and coparent as well as declining marriage rates, to suggest a possible future societal shift in the way people engage in relationships.
“People are branching out more into creating the relationships that make the most sense for their lives,” she says.
While Levinson agrees there will be a continued increase in “creative relationship structures” for similar reasons, she doesn’t think it will become a global phenomenon.
Too many cultures around the world present challenges to people hoping to open their relationships, and the taboo remains globally prevalent.
OkCupid’s head of global communications Michael Kaye has a different view.
“The behaviours we see among daters today have been around forever.
But people are becoming more open and transparent about how they identify [and] what they want in a relationship.
I think with every single passing year, were becoming a little bit less judgmental about others.”

worklife,"As 2022 comes to a close, we're bringing back our favourite pieces of the year.
See the rest of our Best of Worklife 2022 collection for more great reads.Long gone are the days when seeing a film or sharing a milkshake was all it took to solidify a couple as definitively together.
Instead, modern dating has evolved into a delicate – at times complicated – series of ‘baby steps’ for young people.Research has shown that Gen Z’s attitudes towards dating and sex have evolved from the generations before them; they take an especially pragmatic approach to love and sex, and subsequently aren’t prioritising establishing committed romantic relationships the same way their older peers once did.That doesn’t mean, however, that they’re not expressing interest in romance and intimacy entirely; rather, they’re finding new ways to satisfy those wants and needs that fit better into their lives.
This shift has given rise to the idea of the ‘situationship’ – a term that describes the grey area between friendship and a relationship.A situationship gives name to a hard-to-define stage of dating that experts say has skyrocketed in popularity among Gen Z.
“Right now, this solves some kind of need for sex, intimacy, companionship – whatever it is – but this does not have necessarily a long-term time horizon,” says Elizabeth Armstrong, a sociology professor at the University of Michigan, US, whose research centres on sexuality and situationships, specifically.
People are increasingly embracing the relationship classification: the term has hit an all-time high in Google search traffic this year, after starting to gain notable traction late in 2020.
There’s a worldwide interest in situationships, across ethnicities, genders and sexual orientations, adds Armstrong.
The creation – and continued rise ­– of this term, especially among young daters, reveals a lot about how Gen Zers are re-framing what love and sex means, in a way that looks different than the generations before them.The concept of the situationship goes against “this notion that being with someone where it’s not going anywhere is ‘wasting time’"" – Elizabeth Armstrong (Credit: Getty Images)No need to be ‘going somewhere’A situationship is an informal arrangement typically between two people that has components of both emotional and physical connection, yet operates outside the conventional idea of being in an exclusive, committed relationship.
In some cases, situationships are constrained by time and the idea that a casual arrangement is the best fit for the current situation.
This could be the case for two final-year university students, for instance, who might not want to progress into a committed partnership, considering new jobs could take them to new cities after graduating.Armstrong argues situationships are popular because they challenge the ‘relationship escalator’: the idea that intimate partnerships are meant to have a linear structure with the goal of hitting conventional relationship milestones, such as co-habitation, engagement and marriage.
The concept of the situationship goes against “this notion that being with someone where it’s not going anywhere is ‘wasting time’”, she says – a sentiment she notes Gen Z is increasingly embracing.
Rather, people in these arrangements willingly opt into the grey area of an undefined relationship.
According to Armstrong, they believe “the situationship, for whatever reason, works for right now.
And for right now, I'm not going to worry about having a thing that is ‘going somewhere’”.Some research chimes with this.
In interviews with 150 undergraduate students during the 2020 to 2021 academic year, Lisa Wade, associate professor of sociology at Tulane University, US, observed that Gen Z are more reluctant to define the relationship, or even admit to wanting a relationship to progress.
She says her research has shown that “holding one's cards close to one's chest is not unique to today’s young people”, but Gen Z are especially unwilling to share their feelings with each other.On social media, TikTokers and Tweeters – Gen Zers, especially ­– widely share stories of situationships.
On TikTok, videos tagged #situationship have been viewed more than 839 million times, and videos under #situationships and #situationship have also racked up millions of views.
References also abound in pop culture: the term appears in popular dating shows such as Love Island UK and in songs, such as Situationship by millennial Swedish singer Snoh Aalegra.
“We joke, me and my friends, that we're all living the same life,” says Amanda Huhman, 26, whenever she and her friends compare notes on situationships.
Texas-based Huhman has documented the experience of situationships on TikTok.
From her own interactions and the engagement she sees, she believes the arrangement is common.
“I think it's becoming a really popular part of dating culture, at least for Gen Z and people in the young millennial, Gen Z age.” Huhman has spent more than a year in what she describes as a situationship.
When she posted a TikTok about her experience, it garnered close to 8 million views and tens of thousands of comments – many of which were people chiming in about their own situationships.As a healthcare consultant, Huhman works remotely, travels often and moves to new cities for a few months at a time.
Being in a situationship, she says, means she has more freedom and autonomy.
“Our dating culture today is very chaotic and confusing,” believes Huhman.
“[Gen Zers] just live this… busy lifestyle, and I think we've kind of adapted dating to match that.”26-year-old Amanda Huhman is in a situationship, which she says best suits her life right now (Credit: Courtesy of Amanda Huhman)Prioritising personal trajectoryAs Gen Z enters the dating world, finding love has a set of modern challenges.
For instance, the pandemic has entirely changed the way many people meet partners and date, and a large-scale move towards online dating often takes its toll.Additionally, many young people simply aren’t putting the emphasis on dating intentionally that they were in the past; facing the climate crisis, an unstable economy with surging inflation and political and social upheaval, young people are more involved in advocacy and in search of personal, professional and financial stability first.
“Young people would say that relationships are distracting them from their educational and career goals, and that it's best to not get too attached, because you might sacrifice your own trajectory in life for someone else,” says Wade.As a result, situationships can be the best option for Gen Zers looking to explore their romantic and sexual identities without letting other commitments take a backseat.
The phenomenon “diversifies the sense of options that people have”, says Armstrong, and it’s become increasingly normal to opt into this grey area instead of avoiding it.But, of course, this murky-by-definition arrangement doesn’t come without precarity – and even risk.
In theory, situationships can function as a container for “radical honesty”, says Wade, when two people are open about what they really want and agree on the terms of a transparent situationship.
But in practice, it can be difficult for two people’s priorities to align, and situationships can end poorly when each party is not on the same page about what they want out of the situation.
Most commonly, she says this happens when one person is ready to progress to a committed relationship, but a fear of change might keep both people from ever discussing this.Regardless, in today’s dating world, the rising interest in situationships indicates a shift in how young people may re-frame love and sex going forward – newly embracing what they feel is a satisfying middle ground that many daters in prior generations avoided.As for Huhman, she’s perfectly content living in the in-between.
“It's my choice, it's a decision I'm making and I’m happy.
It's working for me,” she says.
“As long as people are comfortable and it feels right to them, then don't worry about what the expectations are.”

See the rest of our Best of Worklife 2022 collection for more great reads.
It is a truth universally acknowledged that there’s nothing better than a pizza party, except maybe an ice cream social.
Field trips are super fun, too.
And you can’t beat a good extra-curricular activity.They’re the best, that is, if you’re in the third grade.
If you’re an adult being forced to attend a team-building exercise, go to a post-work happy hour or celebrate in a conference room with your colleagues lest you be seen as ‘not a team player’, they’re mostly the worst.For more than two years, a complete shake-up of office culture has effectively banished the forced fun of the pre-pandemic era.
Many people have attended some kind of virtual team-building activity or Zoom happy hour, of course.
But workers have by and large been spared the mandatory monthly birthday celebrations, afterhours drinks and outings to obstacle courses.
And now, even as some companies call employees back to the office, ‘fun’ at work isn’t what it used to be.
In a hybrid environment, it’s tough to get everyone together.
Plus, a pandemic-driven priority realignment means many people want to be home with their families as quickly as possible after work – morale-boosting laser tag be damned.But while the compulsory office party may have had its last gasp, a new kind of work fun is more important than ever.
Events that people actually want to attend are a helpful way to facilitate team bonding, and to give those who’d prefer to remain mostly remote a good reason to re-join their colleagues.
Smart companies are working to identify the types of ‘fun’ workers actually like: the things they’ll show up for because they want to, not because their arm’s twisted.
No patience for partiesFor decades, companies have – for better or worse – been working to make their offices fun places to be, says Paul Lopushinsky, founder of Vancouver, British Columbia-based consultancy Playficient.“Over the last 20, 25 years, we’ve seen the rise of these perks no one was considering before,” says Lopushinsky.
Think bean bag chairs, colourful lounges, arcade games and ping-pong tables as well as common areas with beer and cold brew taps.
“We call it ‘the Kindergarten office’, where it looks more like a kindergarten classroom than a workplace.
It started with the major tech companies, and that’s the culture people started to copy.”Workers who've long bristled at compulsory work events, like birthday celebrations, are breathing a sigh of relief in a changed work world (Credit: Getty Images)But there’s always been something a bit insidious about those perks, adds Lopushinsky.
“That culture isn’t really about fun; it’s about getting people to stay longer.
That’s when you get the ping-pong table, the beer on tap.
Now you’re expected to stay after work for happy hour.
It was never mandatory, but if people didn’t, it was used against them, like, ‘you’re not a team player’.”Even in offices without things like giant ball pits, a culture of forced fun has long persisted.
And while some extroverts and expert networkers may genuinely enjoy it, many others have long chafed against it.
“Nobody wants to be told, ‘it’s Hawaiian shirt day!’, and then you’re a pariah if you don’t participate,” says Adrian Gostick, an executive-leadership coach and co-author of a number of books on employee engagement.Participation out of obligation creates a “corporate cult”, according to Lopushinsky, “where it’s almost indoctrination.
You end up with fake smiles.
‘Oh yeah, of course, it’s great here, I just love these activities.’ It’s a culture of harmony with a lot of disharmony just below the surface.”By stripping away the trappings around work – the desk-mates, conference room meetings and working lunches – the pandemic helped many realise that working effectively doesn’t necessarily require bells and whistles.
It also brought the question of work-life balance to the fore, prompting workers to demand new levels of flexibility from their employers.
And just as it changed everything else, the pandemic has forced a shift in office fun, too.
In short, says Gostick, it’s made people a lot less likely to do things they don’t want to do.
“I think the pandemic has made us a little angrier, a little more cynical overall, and people just aren’t putting up with things they consider annoying as much anymore,” he says.
Thus, many were disillusioned by virtual team-building activities organised by managers desperate to keep people engaged.
But that doesn’t mean that colleagues stopped connecting altogether, says Lopushinsky.
They just started doing it in ways they actually found enjoyable.
“On the flip side, the pandemic also led to the rise of more employee-led initiatives,” he says.
Team-building events and ‘fun’ ceased to be top-down.
“Employees would lead a Zoom yoga class, or a cooking class for their colleagues.
It’s an interesting shift, away from ‘you have to do this,’ and toward, ‘what do you guys really want to do?’”Gostick saw a similar trend emerge among his clients as the pandemic wore on.
One, a major American corporation, started holding weekly “wine-and-whine” parties on Zoom.
“It’s like four o’clock on a Friday.
If you want to have a drink you could, or not, whatever.
But you come and whine about the week,” says Gostick.
“It’s an hour, and everybody complains and talks about their terrible clients and aggravating bosses.”Rather than creating a toxic or negative environment, adds Gostick, the wine-and-whine events allow workers to blow off steam, let go of any frustrations from the week, prepare to enjoy the weekend and ultimately feel more refreshed on Monday morning.
It’s an authentic kind of fun employees have continued to embrace as they return to the office.
“Companies know they need to be looking for ways to bring people together that feels more authentic,” he says.
“It’s not about just planning a party.
It’s about making it meaningful, and making people actually want to be there.” Giving workers a good reason to go backToday, after more than two years of remote work, a large number of people no longer want to return to a physical office.
In the US, according to a February 2022 Pew Research study, close to 60% of those who’ve been working from home would prefer to continue doing so.
In the UK, that statistic is even more stark.
Employees that are ordered back, says Gostick, are likely to simply quit.
So, he says, companies need ways to “lure people back”.And they are certainly trying.
Companies are offering everything from food trucks and free T-shirts to, in the case of Google, a private performance by Lizzo.
But while such celebrations might draw a crowd, that enthusiasm wanes when it’s time to go back to their desks.“One of my clients built a big new office during the pandemic, and they finally opened it up a few months ago and had a big party,” says Gostick.
“They had like 90% of people show up.
Everybody had a great time, and they were so excited to see each other.
But then Monday, maybe 10% of people came in.
People are desperate to see each other, but they still prefer to work remotely.”Mandatory socialisation can breed fake smiles – and even stoke discord among workers who feel they have no other option but participate (Credit: Getty Images)The flashy parties may work at first, but companies need a longer-term fun strategy, says Gostick; ways to create fun that are meaningful enough for people to want to participate and compelling enough to keep them coming back.
“It’s a shift from, ‘Everyone gather around, it’s Stan’s birthday and there are cupcakes’, to getting together in a meaningful way,” says Gostick.
That means continuing events – like a wine-and-whine Friday – that were popular and useful during the pandemic, and planning others that don’t require people to stay after working hours, or invest time and energy they might like to spend somewhere else.
It also means understanding that there are some people who simply won’t come, and not holding it against them.
The other half of that equation, of course, is that it can’t be forced.
“It’s got to be no guilt, no obligation,” says Gostick.
“You have to give people the option to opt out.”That’s a benefit to management, too, adds Lopushinsky.
If the ultimate goal of office fun is to facilitate team bonding, it’ll work a lot better if nobody feels obliged to attend.
“That kind of get-together has the most positive impact anyway.
It’s team bonding that would happen naturally, as opposed to forcing it.” Post-pandemic, people are craving a good time and each other’s company more than ever, says Gostick, “and yet the inane office ‘fun’ of yesteryear has wholly passed.
We realise, maybe more than before, that every minute of our time is precious.
If our bosses want it, they’ve got to use it wisely.”

worklife,"Throughout the past few years, workers have been resigning from jobs in record numbers.
Some have been switching careers, some have been job-hopping for faster advancement and some have left the workforce altogether.
In the US, for instance, the August 2022 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics puts the labour force participation rate at 1.0 percentage point below its February 2020 level.In other words, people have been quitting and, in some sectors and jobs, they haven’t been coming back.
Perhaps it’s unsurprising, given the poor conditions in many workplaces throughout the pandemic.
The dearth of workers is most evident in hospitality and service-work industries, where positions for dishwashers, truck drivers, retail workers, food servers, airport agents, home health aides and similar roles have been open for literal years.
This is not because people don’t want to work, say the experts.
They just want better jobs; higher pay, improved conditions.
The job market upheaval caused by the pandemic has enabled some workers to switch into better employment – and if hard-hit sectors want their workers back, they need to find ways of making their jobs more attractive.
Why are these jobs open?Particularly in the US, data shows it’s been tough to be a service worker for a long time.
In 2020, for instance, full-time American food counter workers made, on average, $23,960 (£20,796) a year – failing to clear the poverty line for a four-person household.
Weekly hours have rarely been guaranteed, making it difficult for workers to be sure their income would cover their bills, or arrange things like transport and childcare.All of that, in part, accounts for the fact that the attrition rate – in other words, the rate at which people leave as a percentage of annual average employment – has been high in service industries for a long time.
In 2017, it was 53.8% for retail workers, 72.4% for workers in accommodation and food service and 30.6% for people in manufacturing jobs.Food-service roles have been open for literal years, with employers scrambling to fill these positions (Credit: Getty Images)But if being a service worker was hard pre-pandemic, once it struck things became downright miserable for many.
Retailers that stayed open faced supply-chain disruption, and spikes and drops in customer demand.
Fewer employees had to work more hours, and increased overtime contributed to burnout.
With schools closed and public transport reduced, some workers were negotiating a lack of childcare and a more difficult commute.
Cases of worker abuse and reports of rude customers shot up, and though some companies offered one-time bonuses, few increased wages or offered hazard pay.And in many instances, the work was hazardous.
Other forms of business moved online, but “in the hospitality industry, for instance, it's very hard to replace somebody who's at the reception desk of a hotel with somebody who's working virtually”, says Serge da Motta Veiga, professor of human resource management at EDHEC Business School in Paris.
That meant frontline service workers, forced to interact with colleagues and customers while everyone else was sheltering at home, were among the most vulnerable to Covid-19.
In the first year of the pandemic, 68% of working-age adults who died in the US were labour, retail and service workers.
Understandably, throughout the last two years, attrition rates have shot up.
In 2021, 64.6% of retail workers, a whopping 86.3% of accommodation and food service workers, and just under 40% of manufacturing workers quit their jobs.
While safety – and overall misery – were leading factors, they weren’t the only reasons for the mass exodus.
People also crave stability, which is difficult to come by in a low-wage job: one 2019 study found that minimum wage jobs have a turnover rate more than twice the US national average.
“Those jobs are precarious,” says da Motta Veiga.
“Job security has become the number one thing people want, above even all the other perks, like having a flexible work schedule, or working from wherever you want.”There’s yet another reason so many people quit: because they could.
The staffing shortage has left many companies at the mercy of those who work – or don’t – for them.
With the labour market leaning so far in favour of the worker, it’s been easier for workers to leave one job and get another, further lessening the incentive for people to return to jobs they find undesirable.
The people who used to have those jobs have replaced them with gig work, or moved to new industries, says da Motta Veiga.
“They're trying to transfer their skills into industries where actually they can be respected, well-paid and have more opportunity,” he says.Why aren’t people coming back to fill these jobs?The epidemic of quitting throughout 2021 and into this year, known as the Great Resignation, left job openings across industries.
But David Dwertmann, associate professor of management at Rutgers University School of Business, Camden, US, says it’s been difficult to re-hire workers to fill low-wage jobs in particular, for the same reasons people left them in the first place.He points to a Pew Research Survey that asked people who quit their jobs about their reason for leaving.
Low pay was first, followed by “no opportunities for advancement” and “feeling disrespected”.“If you're flipping burgers or something, it's not that easy to advance.
Not everyone is going to be a manager.
Many people are stuck in these jobs for years and years and years,” says Dwertmann.
Plus, “the workers just don't feel like they're being valued enough, and don't feel like they're being treated well enough”.
With a market awash in better opportunities, people feeling stagnant or mistreated in their jobs seized a golden opportunity to bail.Another factor, adds Dwertmann, is the wave of Baby Boomer retirements that left still more gaps in the workforce.
“It's kind of the perfect storm,” he says.
“I think Covid-19 probably for [Boomers considering retirement] was a great reason to say, ‘You know what?
I'm done.’ Because these are the groups that were at the highest risk of Covid exposure, especially working in some face-to-face service jobs.
I think if they could afford to do so, a large cohort of that particular population just chose to retire.
I would assume that many of them will probably never come back into the labour force.” This Boomer exodus, notes Dwertmann, has been compounded by a lack of immigration during the past several years that has left gaps in industries which normally employ new arrivals.
“In part due to the pandemic, in part due to changes in policy, immigration into the United States actually dropped by half,” he says.
“And these are some of the people that used to fulfil or take some of those low-skill, low-education jobs.”Airport workers are among those who have quit and not returned to their positions (Credit: Getty Images)What are companies doing to try to fill the ‘unfillable’?It’s not unusual, these days, to see signs outside fast-food restaurants, convenience stores and markets offering previously unheard-of starting hourly wages to new hires.
Many employers instituted sign-on bonuses: in 2021, Amazon announced a hiring push and said it would pay $1,000 bonuses for warehouse and transport jobs.
Hilton Hotels began offering sign-on bonuses of $500 and more for room attendants and other staff.Yet while financial incentives don’t hurt, they don’t do anything to address the other major things workers want that those “unfillable” jobs don’t often offer; flexibility, predictability and better conditions.
“I do think employers need to react not just by increasing wages and providing sign-on bonuses, but also, for example, by scheduling employees in different ways,” says Dwertmann.
“Making sure that there's some predictability for employees in terms of when they have to come in, and how many hours they get to work, so that they can, for example, manage childcare.”Focusing on the money alone, agrees da Motta Veiga, is short-sighted.
While, yes, people want to be paid what they feel their time and energy is worth, companies should also “be asking people: ‘What do you want?
What is your priority?
Is it that security?
Is it that flexibility?’” They need to be creative, he says, in making these jobs more attractive.To fill an unfillable job, concludes Dwertmann, you have to make it not only financially worthwhile, but also provide some flexibility, some guarantee of safety and find a way to generate loyalty.“The pandemic comes around and the first thing people do is lay off big troves of workers,” he says.
“They were thinking when it eased up everyone would just show up again, but really employees are like, ‘You know what?
You didn’t stick with me.
I’m not going back to you.’”Correction 21 Sept 2022: An earlier version of this article did not provide sufficient context around the statistic of the percentage of service workers who died during the pandemic.

worklife,"As 2022 comes to a close, we're bringing back our favourite pieces of the year.
See the rest of our Best of Worklife 2022 collection for more great reads.When Laura was invited for a final-stage interview at a multinational music corporation based in London, she thought she was on the cusp of landing her dream role.
After passing a first-round phone interview and meeting team members in person, all Laura had to do was meet a senior-level executive.
“It was presented to me as a formality,” she says.
“The interview went well, and I was later told I’d got the job.”And then – nothing.
Despite receiving initial guarantees she would be joining the team, the email formally confirming Laura's role never arrived.
She’d send occasional follow-ups to the firm’s HR department only to receive non-committal replies.
“It was always me instigating the conversation,” says Laura.
“The last message I received said they promised to contact me as soon as they had more information on my new role.
I never heard from them again.”Laura had been ghosted.
Rather than sending her a formal rejection or an explanation of what had happened, her potential employer ignored her.
It’s a practice that’s common in the recruitment process; one recent study of 1,500 global workers found that 75% of jobseekers have been ghosted by a company after a job interview.
Employers openly acknowledge that they do it; only 27% of US employers surveyed by job listings site Indeed said they hadn’t ghosted a candidate in the past year.But it’s not just companies.
Right now, employees are ghosting back – and potentially in higher numbers than ever before.
In the same 2021 Indeed survey, 28% of workers said that they’d ghosted an employer – compared to 19% two years before.
The phenomenon seems to be happening at all stages of the recruitment process.
While some employers reported that candidates cut off communications following an initial phone screening, a quarter said new hires had “no-showed” on their first day at work.Ghosting is considered bad practice for both companies and workers; no one likes being on the receiving end of it.
Yet its rise seems inexorable: digital hiring processes deluge companies with candidates, making replying to everyone hard, even as labour shortages give job-hunters more options as employers scramble for talent.
Is the inevitable consequence of this an increasingly discourteous recruitment process – or can steps be taken by both sides to avert a downward spiral?Easier – but more impersonal?‘Ghosting’ was originally coined in the dating world: it meant a sudden, unexpected end to all contact.
It’s a social phenomenon increasingly being co-opted in the workplace – and put into practice on either side of the interview table.Being able to suddenly drop communications during the recruitment process generally favours the party in the more powerful position.
Traditionally, employers have been more likely to ghost than the workforce.
However, even before Covid-19, ghosting had become a growing trend among candidates, too: thanks to a tightening job market, they could afford to begin mimicking companies’ behaviour.But the pandemic has acted as a catalyst, fuelling the current spike.
Yuletta Pringle, of the Society for Human Resource Management, based in Virginia, US, says the rise is coming from both workers and employers.
Pringle attributes the uptick to the fall-out from the Great Resignation.
“Labour shortages have left employers pinched and desperate to hire, meaning they have to push out a ton of feelers online and may not be able to respond to everyone,” she explains.
“On the employee side, there are so many job vacancies – they may be ghosting potential employers as they search for their ideal role and move around the recruitment process.”In many cases, recruitment processes have been digitised.
Job-search algorithms place the open positions right in front of workers.
‘Easy apply’ options mean candidates can send off resumes for multiple jobs more effortlessly than ever.
Virtual interviews have improved accessibility, increasing opportunities for employers and workers to find the best fit.
“Before the pandemic, only a fraction of interviews brokered through us would be done virtually,” says Craig Freedberg, a regional director at recruitment firm Robert Half, based in London.
“Now, 99% of our first-stage interviews are via Zoom calls.”However, the convenience of digitised and virtual recruitment comes at a cost.
Employers are having to both widen their net and interview more people as a result of the hiring crisis.
That creates a knock-on effect for hiring managers who, whether inside firms or at external recruitment companies, are dealing with a glut of applicants and roles.
“Much of the ghosting we’re seeing today may simply be the fact that someone just can’t get back to everyone,” says Pringle.
The loss of in-person interviews may also be a factor in ghosting by both parties.
“It can sometimes be harder to build a rapport with someone virtually,” says Freedberg.
“The emotional investment of travelling to meet someone for an in-person interview is difficult to replicate when you’re clicking on a calendar link from home, and it’s easier for employers to ghost when you’re losing that human, face-to-face element.”The process can, therefore, feel increasingly transactional.
And, in the current buoyant job market, applicants may well be swamped, too.
“Candidates are being approached all the time with an abundance of jobs to choose from,” says Freedberg.
“If they have multiple applications on the go, it can be easier to simply ignore one of them.”From the recruiters' end, an explosion of candidates due to new digital recruiting may mean applicants find themselves waiting for emails that never come (Credit: Getty Images)Balancing ghosting and professionalism Market conditions may well mean that not replying to every lead or candidate is becoming more normalised.
But ghosting comes with downsides to both employers and candidates: it leaves a bad impression – likely ending a professional relationship before it’s even begun.For that reason, some companies, particularly relationship-led ones, remain staunchly anti-ghosting – even if they’ve been on the receiving end themselves.
“In our industry, it’s very important to be approachable and build strong relationships, so we’re certainly anti-ghosting,” says Christoph Hardt, founder of consultancy marketplace Comatch, based in Berlin.
“Nevertheless, we’re seeing more of our requests to consultants go unanswered.
That can be seen as unprofessional, but it’s a consequence of the current market: a worker may ghost simply because they’re too busy.”Pringle suggests that both employers and workers could benefit from thinking about what constitutes ghosting and where this strays into unprofessionalism.
“If you have a job posting and, through your digital process, you push out your vacancy to hundreds of candidates but don't reply to each one individually, is that ghosting?
Or, would ghosting be once you've made some contact both ways and then communication drops?
It would be helpful to define it first.”Like its dating namesake, Freedberg believes that interview ghosting is rooted in a lack of commitment.
“A precursor to ghosting is when either party doesn’t feel bought into the process or has that emotional investment,” he says.
“There has to be greater emphasis on approaching people you genuinely think are right for the job.
And, if someone takes time out of their day for an interview, virtually or in person, they deserve feedback.”Pringle believes responsibility for communication still falls on the employer’s side – and says the right kind of communication can limit the prospect of ghosting from the outset.
“If the employer is as clear and specific on the requirements of the position as possible, right at the beginning of the hiring process, then that could help reduce ghosting on the employees’ side,” she says.Keeping in touch with candidates during the recruitment process is also important, stresses Freedberg.
“Much of the time, it’s just about managing expectations,” he says.
“If there are delays to the recruitment process on either side, responding to people’s emails and letting them know will always be considered good practice.”But workers have responsibilities, too.
Freedberg suggests that rather than applying for jobs on autopilot, workers mindfully select positions that offer a good cultural fit.
Otherwise, they risk wasting recruiters’ time.
“If a candidate agrees to meet an employer for an interview, then decides to ghost, then that’s something a client won’t be happy with,” he adds.
“It’s just bad practice.”Generally speaking, for both sides, the rule of thumb seems to be that the further you go down the recruitment process, the less acceptable it is to ghost.
The more effort an applicant or a company has invested in the recruitment process, the ruder an abrupt end to contact will feel.
Inevitably, it will leave a bad impression – as was the case for Laura.In the end, she never received a rejection email.
Instead, the delays, doubt and ghosting she experienced inflicted a deeper psychological blow – one that caused her to rethink her entire career.
“I’d rather have just been told that for whatever reason I didn’t get the job,” she says.
“There were no excuses to ghost me: I’d invested so much time and energy reaching that point, only for them to drop off the face of the Earth.”
